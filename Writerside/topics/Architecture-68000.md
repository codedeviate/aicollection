# 68000

## Overview

The 68000 architecture, also known as the Motorola 68k, is a 16/32-bit microprocessor architecture developed by Motorola in 1979. It was widely used in personal computers, workstations, and embedded systems due to its powerful instruction set and ease of use.

## History of 68000 Architecture

1. **Motorola 68000 (1979)**: The original 16/32-bit processor that started the 68000 architecture.
2. **Motorola 68010 (1982)**: An enhanced version of the 68000 with virtual memory support.
3. **Motorola 68020 (1984)**: Introduced full 32-bit data and address buses, and additional instructions.
4. **Motorola 68030 (1987)**: Included an integrated MMU (Memory Management Unit).
5. **Motorola 68040 (1990)**: Added an integrated FPU (Floating Point Unit) and improved performance.
6. **Motorola 68060 (1994)**: The final and most powerful processor in the 68000 series.

## Key Concepts

- **16/32-bit Architecture**: The 68000 architecture is based on a 16-bit data bus and a 32-bit address bus, allowing it to process 16 bits of data at a time and address up to 4 GB of memory.
- **Registers**: The 68000 has a large set of registers for operations.
- **Addressing Modes**: The 68000 supports various addressing modes for accessing memory.
- **Rich Instruction Set**: The 68000 has a powerful and versatile instruction set, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

### Registers

- **Data Registers (D0-D7)**: Used for general-purpose data operations.
- **Address Registers (A0-A7)**: Used for addressing and pointer operations.
- **Program Counter (PC)**: Points to the next instruction to be executed.
- **Status Register (SR)**: Holds the processor status flags.
- **Stack Pointer (A7)**: Points to the current position in the stack.

### Example: Simple Assembly Program

```assembly
    ORG $1000
    MOVE.B #$00, D0    ; Load D0 with 0
loop:
    ADDI.B #1, D0      ; Add 1 to D0
    MOVE.B D0, $2000   ; Store D0 at address $2000
    CMP.B #$10, D0     ; Compare D0 with 16
    BNE loop           ; Branch to loop if D0 is not equal to 16
    STOP #$2000        ; Stop the processor (end of program)
```

## Differences Between 68000 and Other Architectures

- **16/32-bit vs. 8/16/32/64-bit**: The 68000 is a 16/32-bit architecture, while modern architectures like x86 and ARM are 16, 32, or 64-bit.
- **Rich Instruction Set**: The 68000 has a more powerful and versatile instruction set compared to simpler architectures like the 6500 or 68xx.
- **Large Number of Registers**: The 68000 has more registers compared to earlier 8-bit architectures, allowing for more efficient data processing.

Understanding the 68000 architecture is crucial for low-level programming, performance optimization, and system development in environments where 68000 processors are used.
