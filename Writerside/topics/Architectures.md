    - x86-64 (also known as x64) is the 64-bit extension of the original 32-bit x86 architecture.

2. **ARM**:
    - Developed by ARM Holdings.
    - Predominantly used in mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
    - Increasingly used in laptops and desktops, especially with the introduction of Apple's M1 and M2 chips.

3. **PowerPC**:
    - Developed by IBM, Motorola, and Apple.
    - Historically used in older Apple computers and some gaming consoles.
    - Less common in consumer devices today but still used in some embedded systems.

These architectures are designed to meet different performance, power consumption, and application requirements, making them suitable for various consumer devices.
