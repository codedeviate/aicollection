# Assembly

## Assembly vs assembler

In programming, "assembler" and "assembly" refer to different concepts:

1. **Assembler**:
    - An assembler is a software tool that translates assembly language code into machine code (binary code) that a computer's processor can execute.
    - It takes human-readable assembly instructions and converts them into the corresponding opcodes and operands for the target architecture.

2. **Assembly**:
    - Assembly, or assembly language, is a low-level programming language that is closely related to a computer's machine code instructions.
    - It uses mnemonic codes and labels to represent machine-level instructions, making it easier for humans to read and write compared to raw binary code.

In summary, the assembler is the tool that performs the translation, while assembly is the language being translated.
