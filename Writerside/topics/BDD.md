# BDD

## What is BDD?

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development methodology that extends Test-Driven Development (TDD) by emphasizing collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders. BDD focuses on defining the behavior of software in terms of user stories and acceptance criteria, written in a natural language that all stakeholders can understand.

## Key Principles of BDD

1. **Collaboration**: Involves close cooperation between developers, testers, and business stakeholders to ensure a shared understanding of requirements.
2. **User Stories**: Requirements are expressed as user stories, which describe the desired behavior of the system from the user's perspective.
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Each user story includes acceptance criteria that define the conditions under which the story is considered complete.
4. **Executable Specifications**: Acceptance criteria are written in a way that they can be turned into automated tests.

## BDD Process

1. **Discovery**: Collaborate with stakeholders to understand the requirements and define user stories.
2. **Formulation**: Write acceptance criteria for each user story using a structured format such as Given-When-Then.
3. **Automation**: Implement automated tests based on the acceptance criteria.
4. **Development**: Write the code to make the tests pass.
5. **Verification**: Run the automated tests to verify that the code meets the acceptance criteria.

## Example of BDD Scenario

### User Story

As a user, I want to be able to log in to the application so that I can access my account.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Given** the user is on the login page
- **When** the user enters valid credentials
- **Then** the user should be redirected to the dashboard

### Example in Gherkin Syntax

```gherkin
Feature: User Login

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters valid credentials
    Then the user should be redirected to the dashboard
```

## Conclusion

BDD is a powerful methodology that enhances collaboration and ensures that software meets the needs of its users. By focusing on user stories and acceptance criteria, BDD helps create a shared understanding of requirements and produces high-quality, maintainable software.
