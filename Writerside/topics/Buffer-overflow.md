# Buffer overflow

Testing for buffer overflow is typically categorized as a part of **security testing**, and more specifically, it often falls under **penetration testing** or **vulnerability assessment**, depending on the context:

### 1. **Penetration Testing**
- Penetration testing (pentesting) involves simulating attacks to discover security weaknesses in a system. Testing for buffer overflows is a common component of pentesting, especially when targeting applications written in languages like C or C++ that are prone to memory management issues.
- During pentesting, testers might:
    - Identify inputs that could be used to trigger buffer overflows.
    - Craft payloads to exploit the overflow, potentially gaining control of the system or causing a denial of service.
- Tools such as fuzzers, custom scripts, or frameworks like Metasploit are often used to identify and exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

### 2. **Vulnerability Assessment**
- A vulnerability assessment focuses on identifying and reporting vulnerabilities without actively exploiting them. This approach might involve scanning for known buffer overflow vulnerabilities using automated tools.
- Example tools include Nessus, OpenVAS, and static analysis tools for reviewing codebases for unsafe functions (e.g., `strcpy`, `gets` in C).

### 3. **Static or Dynamic Code Analysis**
- In secure software development practices, testing for buffer overflows may also occur during code reviews, static analysis, or dynamic analysis:
    - **Static Analysis**: Using tools like SonarQube, Coverity, or Clang Analyzer to detect unsafe code patterns that could lead to buffer overflows.
    - **Dynamic Analysis**: Monitoring an application while it runs (e.g., using AddressSanitizer or Valgrind) to detect potential overflow issues.

### 4. **Application Security Testing**
- Application Security Testing (AST) tools, such as SAST (Static Application Security Testing) or DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing), often test for vulnerabilities like buffer overflows as part of a broader suite of checks.

### Summary
Testing for buffer overflows is most commonly associated with **penetration testing** when performed with the intent to exploit vulnerabilities. However, it may also fall under **vulnerability assessment**, **static/dynamic analysis**, or broader **application security testing**, depending on whether the focus is on detection, prevention, or exploitation.
