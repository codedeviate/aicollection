### 54. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

#### Introduction (TCP)
**TCP** is a connection-oriented protocol used in networking to ensure reliable data transmission. It is part of the TCP/IP suite and guarantees the delivery of data between devices.

#### How TCP Works
TCP breaks data into packets, ensures that packets are received in order, and handles retransmissions in case of packet loss. It ensures a reliable connection by performing error checking and acknowledgment.

#### Example of TCP:
- When a user loads a webpage, TCP ensures that the necessary data from the server is received without loss and in the correct order.

---

### 55. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

#### Introduction (UDP)
**UDP** is a connectionless protocol used in networking. Unlike TCP, it does not guarantee reliability or packet order, making it faster but less reliable.

#### How UDP Works
UDP transmits data without establishing a connection between devices. It is ideal for applications where speed is more important than reliability, such as streaming or online gaming.

#### Example of UDP:
- A video streaming service like YouTube might use UDP to deliver video data quickly, even if some packets are lost.
