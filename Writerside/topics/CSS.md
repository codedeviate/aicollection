This section contains information about CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.
CSS is used to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages. The following examples demonstrate various CSS functionalities and best practices to help you understand and implement CSS in your projects effectively.

## History
The CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was developed to separate content from presentation. Here is a brief history:

- **1996**: CSS1 is published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), introducing basic styling capabilities.
- **1998**: CSS2 is released, adding support for media types, absolute and relative positioning, and more.
- **1999**: Work begins on CSS3, which is modularized to allow for faster and more flexible development.
- **2011**: The first CSS3 modules are published as W3C Recommendations, introducing new features such as rounded corners, shadows, gradients, and transitions.
- **2017**: CSS Grid Layout is introduced, providing a powerful layout system for creating complex web designs.
- **2018**: CSS Custom Properties (variables) are widely supported, allowing for more dynamic and maintainable styles.

## CSS Evolution
CSS continues to evolve, with ongoing work to improve the language and add new features.
