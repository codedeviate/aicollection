# C++

This section contains snippets of code written in C++, an extension of the C programming language that includes object-oriented features. C++ is widely used for system/software development, game development, real-time simulations, and performance-critical applications. The following examples demonstrate various C++ functionalities and best practices to help you understand and implement C++ in your projects effectively.

## History

The C++ programming language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs. Here is a brief history:

- **1979**: Bjarne Stroustrup begins work on "C with Classes," the predecessor to C++.
- **1983**: The name of the language is changed to C++.
- **1985**: The first edition of "The C++ Programming Language" by Bjarne Stroustrup is published, and the first commercial implementation of C++ is released.
- **1989**: The Annotated C++ Reference Manual is published, which serves as a basis for future standardization.
- **1990**: The first edition of "The C++ Programming Language" is updated to include new features.
- **1998**: The ISO standard for C++ (ISO/IEC 14882:1998), also known as C++98, is published.
- **2003**: A minor revision of the C++ standard, known as C++03, is released.
- **2011**: The C++11 standard is published, introducing major new features such as auto keyword, range-based for loops, lambda expressions, and smart pointers.
- **2014**: The C++14 standard is released, providing bug fixes and small improvements to C++11.
- **2017**: The C++17 standard is published, adding features like structured bindings, if constexpr, and more.
- **2020**: The C++20 standard is released, introducing concepts, ranges, coroutines, and modules.

C++ continues to evolve, with ongoing work on future standards to improve the language and add new features.
