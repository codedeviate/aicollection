# a.out (Assembler Output Format)

a.out is one of the earliest binary file formats used on Unix systems for executables, object code, and core dumps. While largely obsolete today, it provides a historical foundation for understanding binary file formats. Here's a breakdown of what the a.out header contains and how you can find where the code begins:

---

## Structure of the a.out Header

The a.out header typically contains the following fields:

1. **Magic Number**:
    - Identifies the file as an a.out executable.
    - Common values:
        - `0x0107`: Normal executable.
        - `0x0108`: Read-only text segment.
        - `0x010B`: Demand-paged executable.

2. **Header Fields**:
    - **`a_text`** (4 bytes):
        - Size of the text (code) segment.
    - **`a_data`** (4 bytes):
        - Size of the initialized data segment.
    - **`a_bss`** (4 bytes):
        - Size of the uninitialized data segment (BSS).
    - **`a_syms`** (4 bytes):
        - Size of the symbol table.
    - **`a_entry`** (4 bytes):
        - Entry point address where execution begins.
    - **`a_trsize`** (4 bytes):
        - Size of the text relocation table.
    - **`a_drsize`** (4 bytes):
        - Size of the data relocation table.

## Sections in an a.out File

An a.out file is divided into several segments:

1. **Text Segment**:
    - Contains the executable code.

2. **Data Segment**:
    - Contains initialized variables and constants.

3. **BSS Segment**:
    - Contains uninitialized variables.

4. **Symbol Table**:
    - Stores symbols for debugging and linking.

5. **Relocation Tables**:
    - Used to adjust addresses in the text and data segments during linking or loading.

## Finding Where the Code Begins

To determine where the code starts in an a.out file:

1. **Check the Entry Point (`a_entry`)**:
    - The `a_entry` field in the header specifies the address where execution begins.

2. **Locate the Text Segment**:
    - The text segment starts immediately after the header.
    - Offset of the text segment in the file can be calculated as:
      ```
      text_offset = sizeof(a.out header)
      ```

3. **Disassemble the Code**:
    - Use tools like `objdump` or `gdb` to disassemble the binary and verify the code.

## Commands to Analyze a.out Files

- **`objdump -f <file>`**:
  Displays the file header, including entry point and segment sizes.

- **`objdump -d <file>`**:
  Disassembles the text (code) segment.

- **`nm <file>`**:
  Lists symbols in the file.

- **`gdb <file>`**:
  Debugs the a.out binary, allowing inspection of the header and code.

## Example

```bash
# Display header information
objdump -f example

# Disassemble to find the entry point
objdump -d example

# List symbols
nm example
```

These tools can help you analyze the a.out structure and understand how the binary is organized and executed.
