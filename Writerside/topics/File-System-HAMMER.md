# HAMMER File System

HAMMER is a next-generation file system developed for the DragonFly BSD operating system. It is designed for high performance, data integrity, and scalability, offering features like snapshots, history retention, and fine-grained management of storage. Here's a detailed look at HAMMER and its features:

## Structure of the HAMMER File System

### 1. Master Blocks:
HAMMER uses master blocks to store metadata about the file system:

- **`Volume Information`**:
    - Contains data about the physical storage devices and volume configuration.
- **`Root B-Tree`**:
    - Points to the root of the B-Tree structure, which manages metadata and file data.
- **`Undo Log`**:
    - Tracks changes for transaction consistency and recovery.

### 2. B-Tree Structure:
HAMMER organizes metadata and data using a B-Tree:

- **Internal Nodes**:
    - Store pointers to child nodes for quick lookups.
- **Leaf Nodes**:
    - Contain actual file and directory metadata, as well as references to data blocks.

### 3. Snapshots and History:
HAMMER includes built-in support for snapshots and historical data:

- **Snapshots**:
    - Instantaneous, read-only copies of the file system.
- **History Retention**:
    - Tracks changes over time, allowing recovery of previous versions of files.

### 4. Transactional Integrity:
HAMMER ensures data consistency through its transactional model:

- **Undo Logs**:
    - Changes are recorded in undo logs before being committed to the main file system.
- **Crash Recovery**:
    - Ensures that incomplete transactions are rolled back after a crash.

## Features of HAMMER

- **Snapshots and History**:
    - Create point-in-time snapshots and maintain a history of changes for data recovery.
- **Deduplication**:
    - Identifies and eliminates duplicate blocks to save storage space.
- **Large Volume Support**:
    - Designed to handle file systems up to 1 exabyte in size.
- **Clustered Storage**:
    - Built with future support for clustered file systems.
- **Fine-Grained Filesystem Management**:
    - Tools for pruning historical data and managing storage efficiency.

## Limitations of HAMMER

- **Single-Master Design**:
    - Currently supports only single-master configurations, limiting multi-node scalability.
- **Complex Administration**:
    - Advanced features may require expertise for effective management.
- **Write Performance**:
    - Snapshot and history features can introduce performance overhead in write-heavy workloads.

## Tools and Commands for HAMMER

- **`hammer`**:
    - Primary tool for managing HAMMER file systems.

- **`hammer cleanup`**:
    - Prunes old history and reclaims storage space.

- **`hammer snap`**:
    - Creates snapshots of the file system.

- **`hammer show`**:
    - Displays detailed file system information.

## Example

```bash
# Create a HAMMER file system
newfs_hammer -f /dev/sdX

# Mount a HAMMER file system
mount_hammer /dev/sdX /mnt

# Create a snapshot
hammer snap /mnt /snapshots/snapshot1

# Prune historical data
hammer cleanup /mnt

# Display file system information
hammer show /mnt
```

HAMMER is a powerful file system with features tailored for data integrity, recovery, and efficient management of large-scale storage. Its advanced capabilities make it an excellent choice for enterprise and data-centric environments.
