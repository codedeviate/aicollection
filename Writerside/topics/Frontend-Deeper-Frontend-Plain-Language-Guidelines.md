## What Is Plain Language?

Plain language means expressing ideas clearly and directly. Rather than using technical jargon, convoluted sentences, or overly complex vocabulary, plain language seeks to present information in a way that is:

- **Direct:** Information is presented without unnecessary detail.
- **Clear:** The message avoids ambiguity.
- **Concise:** Sentences are brief and to the point.
- **Accessible:** The content is understandable for people with varied literacy levels.

This approach is essential in many fields—from legal documents to web content—ensuring that your audience quickly grasps the intended message without misinterpretation.

## The Benefits of Using Plain Language

Adopting plain language practices can lead to several significant advantages:

- **Improved Understanding:**  
  Audiences grasp key points quickly, reducing the risk of miscommunication. For example, instructions written in plain language minimize confusion about procedures or next steps.

- **Enhanced Accessibility:**  
  Plain language makes content inclusive, helping individuals with diverse cognitive abilities or those for whom the language is not a first language.

- **Increased Engagement:**  
  Clear and succinct content keeps readers interested. People are more likely to read, share, and act on information they can understand immediately.

- **Legal and Regulatory Compliance:**  
  Many government and regulatory bodies require public documents to be written in plain language to ensure transparency and accountability.

## Core Guidelines for Plain Language

Here are several guidelines and strategies for implementing plain language in your communications:

### 1. Use Active Voice

**Active voice** makes sentences direct and dynamic. Instead of saying, "The report was completed by the team," say, "The team completed the report." This shift reduces ambiguity and improves readability.

**Example:**
- **Before:** "Changes to the policy were implemented by the administration."
- **After:** "The administration implemented the policy changes."

### 2. Opt for Common Words and Phrases

Avoid jargon, acronyms, or technical terms when simpler words will do. If specialized language is necessary, define it clearly.

**Example:**
- **Before:** "Utilize the aforementioned apparatus to expedite the process."
- **After:** "Use the tool to speed up the process."

### 3. Keep Sentences and Paragraphs Short

Break down complex ideas into bite-sized pieces. Short sentences and paragraphs help readers process information more effectively.

**Tip:** Aim for sentences that are 15–20 words long. Use transitional phrases to maintain coherence without overwhelming the reader.

### 4. Be Direct and Specific

Eliminate unnecessary words and avoid vague expressions. Be explicit about what you are describing or instructing.

**Example:**
- **Before:** "It is advisable to ensure that the documentation is reviewed thoroughly prior to its final submission."
- **After:** "Review the documentation before the final submission."

### 5. Use Headings, Bullets, and Lists

Organize content with clear headings and lists. These elements help break up text, making the structure of your message immediately apparent.

**Example:**
- **Before:** A long, continuous block of text explaining steps to troubleshoot a problem.
- **After:**  
  **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    - **Step 1:** Restart your device.
    - **Step 2:** Check your internet connection.
    - **Step 3:** Refer to the troubleshooting guide if the issue persists.

### 6. Consider the Reader’s Perspective

Focus on what the reader needs to know. Ask yourself: "How would someone unfamiliar with this topic understand this?" Tailor the language to match the audience's level of expertise.

## Real-World Applications of Plain Language

### Government and Legal Documents

Many governments worldwide now mandate the use of plain language in official communications. For example, the U.S. Plain Writing Act of 2010 requires federal agencies to use clear language in public documents, ensuring that citizens understand policies, laws, and rights. This has led to simpler forms, clearer public health advisories, and more accessible legal documents.

### Healthcare Communications

In the healthcare industry, plain language can literally be a matter of life and death. Patient information leaflets, medication instructions, and informed consent documents are all clearer when written in plain language. Simplified instructions help patients follow treatment plans and reduce the risk of medical errors.

### Digital and Web Content

Websites, especially those related to e-commerce, news, or customer service, benefit immensely from plain language. Clear headings, bullet points, and simple instructions help users navigate content quickly. For instance, a retail website might use plain language in its FAQs to help customers resolve issues without needing additional support.

**Example:**  
A bank’s online guide might say:
- **Before:** "We endeavor to ensure the expeditious processing of your financial transactions."
- **After:** "We work to process your transactions quickly."

### Educational Materials

Textbooks, instructional guides, and online courses that use plain language improve learning outcomes. By stripping away complexity, educators can help students grasp fundamental concepts more effectively.

### 2. Revise and Edit

- **Peer Reviews:** Have colleagues review your content for clarity.
- **Iterative Improvements:** Don’t hesitate to rewrite sentences or paragraphs until they are as clear and direct as possible.

### 3. Create a Style Guide

Develop a style guide for your organization that outlines plain language principles. This guide should cover vocabulary, sentence structure, and formatting to ensure consistency across all communications.

### 4. Training and Workshops

Invest in plain language training for your team. Workshops can provide practical exercises and real-time feedback, making it easier to adopt these practices across your organization.
