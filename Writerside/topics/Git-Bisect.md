# bisect

The `git bisect` command is used to find the commit that introduced a bug by performing a binary search through the commit history. This is particularly useful for large repositories with many commits.

## Detailed Explanation

1. **Starting Bisect**: You start the bisect process by specifying a known good commit and a known bad commit. Git will then check out a commit in the middle of the range.

2. **Marking Commits**: You mark each commit as good or bad using `git bisect good` and `git bisect bad`. Based on your input, Git will narrow down the range of commits to find the exact commit that introduced the bug.

3. **Automating Bisect**: You can automate the bisect process by providing a script that tests for the bug. Git will run the script at each step and mark the commit as good or bad based on the script's exit status.

4. **Ending Bisect**: Once the offending commit is found, you end the bisect process using `git bisect reset`, which returns your repository to its original state.

## Examples

1. **Starting Bisect**:
   ```sh
   git bisect start
   git bisect bad HEAD
   git bisect good v1.0
   ```
   This starts the bisect process with the current commit marked as bad and the `v1.0` tag marked as good.

2. **Marking a Commit as Good**:
   ```sh
   git bisect good
   ```
   This marks the current commit as good, indicating that the bug was not present in this commit.

3. **Marking a Commit as Bad**:
   ```sh
   git bisect bad
   ```
   This marks the current commit as bad, indicating that the bug is present in this commit.

4. **Automating Bisect with a Script**:
   ```sh
   git bisect start
   git bisect bad HEAD
   git bisect good v1.0
   git bisect run ./test-script.sh
   ```
   This starts the bisect process and uses `./test-script.sh` to automatically test each commit. The script should exit with status 0 if the commit is good and non-zero if the commit is bad.

## Common use cases
Common use cases for the `git bisect` command include:

1. **Identifying the Commit that Introduced a Bug**: When a bug is discovered, `git bisect` can help pinpoint the exact commit that introduced the bug by performing a binary search through the commit history.

2. **Finding Performance Regressions**: If a performance issue is detected, `git bisect` can be used to find the commit that caused the regression by testing the performance at each step.

3. **Locating the Source of a Test Failure**: When a test starts failing, `git bisect` can help identify the commit that caused the test to fail, making it easier to understand and fix the issue.

4. **Debugging Complex Codebases**: In large repositories with many commits, `git bisect` can efficiently narrow down the range of commits to find the one responsible for a problem, saving time and effort compared to manually checking each commit.
