# blame

The `git blame` command is used to display the author information and commit details for each line of a file. This is useful for identifying who made specific changes and when those changes were made.

## Detailed Explanation

1. **Basic Usage**: `git blame` shows the commit hash, author, date, and the line number for each line in the file. This helps in tracking the history of changes line by line.

2. **Options**:
    - `-L <start>,<end>`: Limits the output to the specified line range.
    - `-e`: Shows the email address of the author instead of the name.
    - `-w`: Ignores whitespace changes when assigning blame.

3. **Use Cases**:
    - Identifying the author of a specific line of code.
    - Understanding the history of changes for a particular section of a file.
    - Debugging and code reviews to trace the origin of a bug or feature.

## Examples

1. **Basic Blame**:
   ```sh
   git blame Writerside/topics/Git-Blame.md
   ```
   This command shows the commit history for each line in the `Writerside/topics/Git-Blame.md` file.

2. **Blame with Line Range**:
   ```sh
   git blame -L 1,10 Writerside/topics/Git-Blame.md
   ```
   This command shows the commit history for lines 1 to 10 in the `Writerside/topics/Git-Blame.md` file.
