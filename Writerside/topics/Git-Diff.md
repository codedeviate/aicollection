# Diff

The `git diff` command is used to show the differences between various Git data sources, such as working directory, staging area, and commits. It is a powerful tool for reviewing changes before committing them or for comparing different versions of a repository.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Comparing Working Directory and Staging Area**: By default, `git diff` shows the changes between the working directory and the staging area. This helps you see what changes have been made but not yet staged for commit.

2. **Comparing Staging Area and Last Commit**: Using `git diff --cached` (or `git diff --staged`), you can see the differences between the staging area and the last commit. This is useful for reviewing what will be included in the next commit.

3. **Comparing Commits**: You can compare two commits by specifying their commit hashes. This shows the changes between those two points in the repository's history.

4. **Comparing Branches**: You can compare the differences between two branches by specifying their names. This helps in understanding what changes are in one branch but not in another.

5. **Comparing Files**: You can also specify a file or directory to see the differences only for that specific path.

### Examples

1. **Comparing Working Directory and Staging Area**:
   ```sh
   git diff
   ```
   This command shows the changes in the working directory that have not yet been staged for commit.

2. **Comparing Staging Area and Last Commit**:
   ```sh
   git diff --cached
   ```
   This command shows the changes that have been staged for commit but not yet committed.

These examples demonstrate how `git diff` can be used to review changes at different stages of the Git workflow.
