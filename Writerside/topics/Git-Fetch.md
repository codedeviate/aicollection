# fetch

The `git fetch` command is used to download commits, files, and references from a remote repository into your local repository. Unlike `git pull`, it does not merge the changes into your working directory. Instead, it updates your remote-tracking branches, allowing you to review the changes before integrating them.

## Detailed Explanation

1. **Fetching Changes**: `git fetch` retrieves the latest changes from the remote repository but does not modify your working directory. It updates the remote-tracking branches.

2. **Remote-Tracking Branches**: These branches track the state of branches in the remote repository. For example, `origin/master` tracks the `master` branch of the remote named `origin`.

3. **Reviewing Changes**: After fetching, you can review the changes using commands like `git log` or `git diff` before deciding to merge them into your local branches.

4. **Fetching Specific Branches**: You can fetch changes for specific branches or all branches from the remote repository.

5. **Fetching Tags**: You can also fetch tags from the remote repository.

## Examples

1. **Fetching All Changes from the Remote Repository**:
   ```sh
   git fetch origin
   ```
   This command fetches all changes from the remote repository named `origin`.

2. **Fetching a Specific Branch**:
   ```sh
   git fetch origin master
   ```
   This command fetches changes from the `master` branch of the remote repository named `origin`.

3. **Fetching All Branches and Tags**:
   ```sh
   git fetch --all
   ```
   This command fetches changes from all branches and tags from all configured remotes.

4. **Fetching Tags Only**:
   ```sh
   git fetch origin --tags
   ```
   This command fetches all tags from the remote repository named `origin`.
