# Instaweb

The `git instaweb` command is a tool that allows you to browse your Git repository using a web interface. It sets up a temporary web server to serve the repository's content, making it easier to view and navigate the repository's history, branches, and commits.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Starting the Web Server**: `git instaweb` starts a web server to serve the repository's content. By default, it uses the `lighttpd` web server, but you can configure it to use other web servers like `apache2` or `webrick`.

2. **Stopping the Web Server**: You can stop the web server when you are done browsing the repository.

3. **Configuration**: You can configure various options for `git instaweb`, such as the web server to use, the port to run on, and the browser to open.

### Examples

1. **Starting the Web Server**:
   ```sh
   git instaweb --start
   ```
   This command starts the web server and opens the default web browser to view the repository.

2. **Starting the Web Server with a Specific Browser**:
   ```sh
   git instaweb --start --browser=firefox
   ```
   This command starts the web server and opens the repository in Firefox.

3. **Stopping the Web Server**:
   ```sh
   git instaweb --stop
   ```
   This command stops the web server.

These commands help you quickly set up a web interface to browse your Git repository, making it easier to navigate and understand the repository's structure and history.
