# push

The `git push` command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repository. It's an essential part of collaborating with others, as it allows you to share your changes and integrate changes made by others.

## Detailed Explanation

1. **Remote Repositories**: A remote repository is a version of your project that is hosted on the internet or another network. It can be accessed by multiple collaborators. The most common remote repository is `origin`.

2. **Branches**: When you push changes, you typically push them to a specific branch in the remote repository. By default, this is the same branch you are currently on.

3. **Tracking Branches**: A tracking branch is a local branch that has a direct relationship with a remote branch. When you push changes, Git knows which remote branch to push to.

4. **Authentication**: Pushing to a remote repository usually requires authentication. This can be done using SSH keys, HTTPS, or other methods.

## Examples

1. **Pushing to the Default Remote and Branch**:
   ```sh
   git push
   ```
   This command pushes the changes from your local repository to the remote repository `origin` on the current branch.

2. **Pushing to a Specific Remote and Branch**:
   ```sh
   git push origin master
   ```
   This command pushes the changes from your local `master` branch to the `master` branch in the remote repository `origin`.
