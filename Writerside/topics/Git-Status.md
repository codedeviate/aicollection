# status

The `git status` command is used to display the state of the working directory and the staging area. It allows you to see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This command is essential for understanding the current status of your repository.

## Detailed Explanation

1. **Untracked Files**: These are files in your working directory that are not being tracked by Git. They have not been added to the staging area.

2. **Tracked Files**: These are files that Git is tracking. They can be in one of three states:
    - **Unmodified**: Files that have not changed since the last commit.
    - **Modified**: Files that have been changed but not yet staged.
    - **Staged**: Files that have been added to the staging area and are ready to be committed.

3. **Branch Information**: `git status` also shows the current branch you are on and whether your branch is ahead, behind, or has diverged from the remote branch.

## Examples

1. **Basic `git status`**:
   ```sh
   git status
   ```
   This command shows the status of the working directory and the staging area, including untracked files, modified files, and staged files.

2. **Short Status**:
   ```sh
   git status -s
   ```
   This command provides a more compact output. It uses symbols to indicate the status of each file (e.g., `??` for untracked files, `M` for modified files).

3. **Branch and Tracking Information**:
   ```sh
   git status -b
   ```
   This command shows the branch and tracking information in addition to the status of the working directory and staging area. It is useful for understanding the relationship between your local branch and the remote branch.
