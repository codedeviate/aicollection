# apply

`git apply` is a command used to apply a patch to files and/or the index. It reads the supplied diff output (patch) and applies it to the working directory. This is useful for applying changes that were generated by `git diff` or `git format-patch`.

## Basic Usage

1. **Applying a Patch File**

   To apply a patch file to your working directory, use the following command:

   ```sh
   git apply patch_file.patch
   ```

   This will apply the changes described in `patch_file.patch` to your working directory.

2. **Applying a Patch from Standard Input**

   You can also apply a patch directly from standard input:

   ```sh
   git apply < patch_file.patch
   ```

3. **Applying a Patch with Verbose Output**

   To see more detailed output while applying a patch, use the `--verbose` option:

   ```sh
   git apply --verbose patch_file.patch
   ```

4. **Checking if a Patch Can Be Applied**

   Before actually applying a patch, you can check if it can be applied cleanly using the `--check` option:

   ```sh
   git apply --check patch_file.patch
   ```

5. **Applying a Patch in Reverse**

   If you need to undo a patch, you can apply it in reverse using the `-R` option:

   ```sh
   git apply -R patch_file.patch
   ```

## Example

Suppose you have a patch file named `fix_bug.patch` with the following content:

```diff
diff --git a/file.txt b/file.txt
index 83db48f..bf3a5c6 100644
--- a/file.txt
+++ b/file.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
-Hello, World!
+Hello, Git!
 This is a sample file.
```

To apply this patch to your repository, you would run:

```sh
git apply fix_bug.patch
```

After running this command, the changes described in `fix_bug.patch` will be applied to `file.txt` in your working directory.
