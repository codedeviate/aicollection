# 10 Most Common Pitfalls

### 1. Ignoring Error Handling
Go encourages explicit error handling. Ignoring errors can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

### 2. Using Global Variables
Global variables can lead to race conditions and make the code harder to test and maintain.

### 3. Improper Use of Goroutines
Creating too many goroutines without proper synchronization can lead to resource exhaustion and race conditions.

### 4. Misusing Channels
Improper use of channels, such as forgetting to close them or using them for inappropriate tasks, can cause deadlocks and memory leaks.

### 5. Inefficient String Concatenation
Using the `+` operator for string concatenation in loops can be inefficient. Use `strings.Builder` instead.

### 6. Ignoring Context
Not using `context.Context` for managing timeouts and cancellations can lead to resource leaks and unresponsive applications.

### 7. Poor Package Organization
Improper package organization can make the codebase difficult to navigate and maintain. Follow Go's conventions for package structure.

### 8. Overusing Interfaces
Defining interfaces prematurely or using them excessively can lead to unnecessary complexity. Define interfaces only when needed.

### 9. Not Using `defer` Properly
Misusing `defer` can lead to resource leaks. Ensure that `defer` is used to release resources like files and locks.

### 10. Ignoring Go's Concurrency Model
Not understanding Go's concurrency model can lead to inefficient and incorrect use of goroutines and channels. Learn and apply Go's concurrency patterns correctly.
