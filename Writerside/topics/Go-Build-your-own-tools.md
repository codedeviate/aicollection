Welcome to **Build Your Own Tools in Go**, a comprehensive mini-course designed to empower you to create your own command-line tools using the Go programming language.

Go, also known as Golang, is a powerful yet simple programming language that is widely used for creating high-performance applications, particularly in the realm of networking and system-level programming. This course focuses on equipping you with the skills to design and implement practical tools that can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## What You Will Learn

This course is tailored to provide a step-by-step guide on how to build a variety of command-line tools in Go, ranging from basic utilities to advanced applications. Whether you're a beginner in Go or an experienced developer looking to broaden your skill set, this course will help you:

- Understand the fundamentals of building command-line tools in Go.
- Gain hands-on experience with Go's standard libraries for networking, concurrency, and I/O.
- Develop a deeper understanding of network protocols and their practical applications.
- Build tools that enhance productivity and solve common networking and system tasks.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into four main sections, each focusing on a specific category of tools:

### 1. Basic Network Tools
[Go to section](Go-Tools-Stage-1.md)

Learn to implement classic networking utilities that are indispensable for diagnostics and troubleshooting. In this section, you'll build simple but powerful tools like:
- **Ping**: Send ICMP echo requests to check host reachability.
- **Whois**: Query domain ownership information.
- **Dig/nslookup**: Resolve DNS queries.
- **Traceroute**: Trace the route packets take to a host.
- **Netstat**: Display network connections and statistics.
- **Netscan**: Scan a network to discover active hosts.

By the end of this section, you will have developed foundational skills in creating tools that interact with basic network protocols.

### 2. Advanced Network Tools
[Go to section](Go-Tools-Stage-2.md)

Expand your capabilities by building more sophisticated tools for analyzing and interacting with networks. This section covers:
- **Port Scanner**: Scan for open ports on a target machine.
- **IP Geolocation**: Determine a machine's geographical location based on its IP address.
- **Port Knocking**: Implement a security mechanism that grants access only after specific ports are accessed in sequence.
- **Packet Sniffer**: Capture and analyze network packets.
- **Proxy Server** and **Port Forwarding**: Set up intermediaries for network requests.
- **Bandwidth Monitor**: Measure and monitor network usage.
- **Web Crawler** and **Web Scraper**: Automate browsing and data extraction from websites.

These projects will give you hands-on experience with Go's advanced features, such as concurrency and low-level networking.

### 3. Network Services
[Go to section](Go-Tools-Stage-3.md)

Dive deeper into building and managing network services with tools like:
- **HTTP/HTTPS Clients and Servers**: Create applications that interact with web protocols.
- **FTP/FTPS Clients and Servers**: Handle file transfers over traditional and secure channels.
- **SMTP Clients and Servers**: Send and manage email messages.
- **Telnet and SSH Clients and Servers**: Access and control remote machines.
- **DNS and DHCP Clients and Servers**: Work with domain name and IP address management.
- **VPN Clients and Servers**: Secure network communications with virtual private networks.

In this section, you will learn how to build both client and server-side applications, providing a complete understanding of network service architecture.

### 4. Security Tools
[Go to section](Go-Tools-Stage-4.md)

The final section emphasizes building security and infrastructure tools to enhance network reliability and protection:
- **Firewall**: Monitor and control incoming/outgoing network traffic.
- **Load Balancer**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers for better efficiency.
- **Reverse Proxy**: Manage incoming requests and route them to appropriate backend services.

These projects will provide insight into creating robust and secure network applications.

---

### 5. Miscellaneous Tools
[Go to section](Go-Tools-Stage-5.md)

Explore additional tools that don't fit neatly into the previous categories but are invaluable for day-to-day tasks:
- **jq-style JSON Parser**: Process and manipulate JSON data directly from the command line.
- **Log Analyzer**: Parse and summarize log files.
- **File Compressor**: Compress and decompress files in various formats.
- **Task Scheduler**: Automate repetitive tasks using cron-like functionality.
- **Text Processor**: Perform operations like search, replace, and formatting on text files.

This section showcases the versatility of Go in building utilities that simplify complex workflows.
