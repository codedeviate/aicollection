# Go Programming Course for Developers

## Course Overview
This course is designed for developers who are already proficient in at least one programming language and want to learn Go (Golang). The focus will be on Go-specific concepts, best practices, and idiomatic programming. By the end of the course, participants will be able to build efficient, clean, and maintainable Go applications.

## Course Outline

### **Module 1: Introduction to Go**
#### Topics (1):
- Why Go? Overview of Go's features and use cases.
- Setting up the Go environment.
- Writing your first Go program.
- Key differences between Go and your current language (e.g., Python, Java, C++).

#### Hands-On (1):
- Install Go and configure your development environment.
- Create a simple "Hello, World!" program.
- Experiment with Go’s `go run` and `go build` commands.

---

### **Module 2: Go Basics**
#### Topics (2):
- Go syntax and basic constructs (variables, constants, and functions).
- Data types, arrays, slices, and maps.
- Control structures: loops, conditionals, and switches.

#### Hands-On (2):
- Implement basic programs using slices and maps.
- Write a function that calculates factorials recursively and iteratively.

---

### **Module 3: Go’s Unique Features**
#### Topics (3):
- Pointers and memory management in Go.
- Go’s concurrency model: goroutines and channels.
- Error handling: idiomatic use of errors and the `error` type.

#### Hands-On (3):
- Create a program that uses goroutines for concurrent processing.
- Use channels to synchronize goroutines.
- Write functions that handle errors gracefully.

---

### **Module 4: Structs and Interfaces**
#### Topics (4):
- Structs and methods.
- Embedding and composition.
- Interfaces and polymorphism.

#### Hands-On (4):
- Build a simple application using structs and methods.
- Implement an interface and create multiple types that satisfy it.

---

### **Module 5: Packages and Modules**
#### Topics (5):
- Organizing code into packages.
- Using and creating Go modules.
- Working with the Go standard library.

#### Hands-On (5):
- Refactor a multi-file program into a structured package.
- Create and publish a Go module.
- Explore Go’s standard library with a focus on `fmt`, `os`, and `net/http`.

---

### **Module 6: Testing and Benchmarking**
#### Topics (6):
- Writing unit tests with `testing`.
- Using table-driven tests.
- Benchmarking Go code.
- Coverage analysis and improving test coverage.

#### Hands-On (6):
- Write unit tests for a small Go package.
- Perform benchmarking and optimize a given function.

---

### **Module 7: Advanced Topics**
#### Topics (7):
- Reflection in Go.
- Working with JSON and XML.
- Building REST APIs.
- Dependency management with `go mod`.

#### Hands-On (7):
- Create a REST API with Go.
- Parse and manipulate JSON data.
- Use reflection to dynamically interact with structs.

---

### **Module 8: Deployment and Optimization**
#### Topics (8):
- Building and running Go applications in production.
- Logging and debugging techniques.
- Profiling with `pprof`.

#### Hands-On (8):
- Deploy a Go application as a Docker container.
- Profile a program to identify bottlenecks.

---
