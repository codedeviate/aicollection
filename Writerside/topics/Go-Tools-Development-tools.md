## Course Description

This course covers developing tools in Go that makes your understanding of the language more profound. You will learn how to use the tools provided by the Go ecosystem to streamline your development workflow, identify and fix common issues, and optimize the performance of your applications. By the end of the course, you will have a solid understanding of the various tools provided by the Go ecosystem and how to integrate them into your development process.

## Course overview


## Course Objectives

## Target Audience

The course is designed for developers who are already proficient in Go and want to enhance their skills by learning how to develop tools in Go. It is also suitable for developers who are familiar with other programming languages and want to learn how to use Go's tools to streamline their development workflow.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should have a good understanding of Go programming language and be familiar with basic concepts such as variables, functions, data types, and control structures. You should also have experience working with the Go standard library and be comfortable using the command line.

## Course Structure

### Section 1: The make tool

In this section, you will learn how to create a `make`-like program in Go. You will implement features such as reading a configuration file (like a `Makefile`), parsing dependencies, and executing commands. By the end of this section, you will have developed a basic tool for reading tasks, resolving dependencies, and running commands.
