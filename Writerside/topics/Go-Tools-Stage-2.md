# Advanced Network Tools

In this stage of the course, we delve into **Advanced Network Tools**, focusing on building more sophisticated and versatile applications that go beyond the basics. These tools not only extend your understanding of networking but also introduce you to advanced concepts like security, data interception, and automation.

The projects in this section will challenge you to leverage Go's powerful libraries and concurrency features to create robust tools capable of solving complex networking problems. Youâ€™ll gain hands-on experience with protocols, data processing, and system-level operations, enabling you to handle real-world networking scenarios with confidence.

## Tools We Will Build

### 1. [Port Scanner](Go-Tools-Port-Scanner.md)
A port scanner identifies open ports on a target machine, providing insights into available services and potential security vulnerabilities. In this module, you will:
- Implement both TCP and UDP port scanning techniques.
- Optimize for performance using concurrency in Go.
- Handle edge cases like closed or filtered ports.

This project will teach you how to efficiently scan networks and interpret port statuses.

---

### 2. [IP Geolocation](Go-Tools-IP-Geolocation.md)
The IP Geolocation tool maps an IP address to its physical location, providing details like city, region, country, and ISP. You will:
- Use public APIs or databases to fetch geolocation information.
- Parse and display results in an easy-to-read format.
- Enhance the tool with features like batch lookups or caching.

This project will improve your skills in API integration and working with external data sources.

---

### 3. [Port Knocking](Go-Tools-Port-Knocking.md)
Port Knocking is a security technique where access to a system is granted only after a sequence of specific ports is "knocked." You will:
- Implement a server-side port-knocking mechanism.
- Build a client tool to send the correct sequence of packets.
- Handle errors and unauthorized attempts gracefully.

This project introduces you to secure communication and custom protocol design.

---

### 4. [Packet Sniffer](Go-Tools-Packet-Sniffer.md)
A Packet Sniffer captures and analyzes network traffic, allowing you to inspect packet details. You will:
- Use Go libraries to access raw network data.
- Parse protocols like TCP, UDP, and HTTP to extract meaningful information.
- Implement filters for specific types of traffic.

This tool will deepen your understanding of low-level networking and data parsing.

---

### 5. [Proxy Server](Go-Tools-Proxy-Server.md)
A Proxy Server acts as an intermediary for requests between clients and servers. In this module, you will:
- Build an HTTP/HTTPS proxy that forwards and modifies requests.
- Implement logging and caching for improved performance.
- Add features like authentication or traffic inspection.

This project highlights the practical use of proxies in enhancing privacy, performance, and security.

---

### 6. [Port Forwarding](Go-Tools-Port-Forwarding.md)
Port Forwarding redirects network traffic from one port to another, often across different machines. You will:
- Set up forwarding rules to reroute incoming traffic.
- Handle multiple forwarding sessions concurrently.
- Add safeguards to prevent unauthorized access.

This project explores how to control and manage network traffic effectively.

---

### 7. [Bandwidth Monitor](Go-Tools-Bandwidth-Monitor.md)
A Bandwidth Monitor tracks and displays network usage in real-time. In this module, you will:
- Measure inbound and outbound traffic on network interfaces.
- Visualize usage trends using terminal-based charts or logs.
- Handle high-throughput data efficiently.

This tool is essential for monitoring network performance and troubleshooting bandwidth issues.

---

### 8. [Web Crawler](Go-Tools-Web-Crawler.md)
A Web Crawler systematically browses web pages and retrieves data, making it a foundational tool for indexing or analysis. You will:
- Build a crawler that follows links and downloads pages.
- Respect robots.txt guidelines to avoid scraping restrictions.
- Handle rate limiting and large-scale crawling challenges.

This project demonstrates how to automate web navigation and data collection.

---

### 9. [Web Scraper](Go-Tools-Web-Scraper.md)
A Web Scraper extracts specific information from web pages, such as prices, headlines, or metadata. In this module, you will:
- Parse HTML and JSON responses to retrieve targeted data.
- Use Go libraries like `net/http` and `goquery` for efficient scraping.
- Handle dynamic content and pagination.

This tool is widely used for data collection, automation, and analytics.

## Why This Section Matters

The tools in this section build on the basics and provide a more in-depth exploration of networking and system-level programming. By the end of this stage, you will have gained:
- Proficiency in implementing advanced features like concurrency, API integration, and protocol parsing.
- A deeper understanding of network security and traffic management.
- The ability to create versatile tools that solve real-world problems.

These skills will prepare you for the next phase of the course, where we explore building complete **Network Services**.
