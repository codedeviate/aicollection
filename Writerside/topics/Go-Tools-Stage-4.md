# Security Tools

In this section of the course, we focus on building **Security Tools**, which are essential for safeguarding networks, systems, and applications. These tools form the defensive layer of any infrastructure, protecting it against unauthorized access, mitigating attacks, and ensuring high availability.

Through these projects, you will learn how to design and implement systems that monitor, manage, and secure networks effectively. This stage emphasizes advanced concepts like traffic control, request routing, and intrusion prevention. By leveraging Go's powerful networking and concurrency features, you will build tools that are performant and scalable for real-world security challenges.

## Tools We Will Build

### 1. Firewall
[Go to lesson](Go-Tools-Firewall.md)

A firewall is a critical security tool that controls and monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules. In this module, you will:
- Build a packet filtering system that inspects network traffic.
- Implement rules for allowing or blocking specific IPs, ports, and protocols.
- Add logging to monitor traffic and detect suspicious activities.

You’ll gain an in-depth understanding of how firewalls enforce security policies and protect systems from external threats.

### 2. Load Balancer
[Go to lesson](Go-Tools-Load-Balancer.md)

A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and reliability. You will:
- Design a load balancer that uses algorithms like round-robin, least connections, or IP hashing.
- Handle session persistence and server health checks.
- Optimize for scalability and fault tolerance.

This project will teach you how to manage heavy traffic loads and improve the performance of web services.

### 3. Reverse Proxy
[Go to lesson](Go-Tools-Reverse-Proxy.md)

A reverse proxy sits between clients and servers, forwarding client requests to the appropriate backend service. In this module, you will:
- Build a reverse proxy that handles HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
- Implement request routing based on paths, headers, or query parameters.
- Add features like caching, compression, and SSL termination.

You’ll learn how reverse proxies improve performance, enhance security, and simplify deployment.

## Why This Section Matters

This stage brings together the knowledge and skills you’ve developed throughout the course, focusing on creating tools that protect and optimize network environments. By the end of this section, you will have:
- Mastered the fundamentals of network security and traffic management.
- Built practical tools that address real-world security challenges.
- Gained the ability to design and implement scalable, secure systems.

These security tools not only strengthen your understanding of Go programming but also equip you with expertise to tackle advanced networking and cybersecurity problems.
