# Miscellaneous Tools

In this section of the course, we explore a diverse set of **Miscellaneous Tools** that enhance productivity, streamline workflows, and optimize system operations. These tools address a wide range of real-world problems, from data parsing and log analysis to file compression and task automation. By working through these projects, you will develop a deeper understanding of how versatile tools can simplify complex tasks.

This section focuses on practical utility, emphasizing the design and implementation of lightweight, effective solutions that can be applied across various domains. By leveraging Go's powerful standard library and third-party packages, you will build tools that are robust and efficient.

## Tools We Will Build

### 1. jq - JSON Processor
[Go to lesson](Go-Tools-JQ.md)

The jq tool is invaluable for parsing, manipulating, and querying JSON data. In this module, you will:
- Build a command-line utility to filter and transform JSON data.
- Implement support for querying using a custom syntax.
- Add features for pretty-printing and compacting JSON outputs.

This project will teach you how to handle structured data effectively, enabling seamless integration with APIs and other JSON-based systems.

### 2. Log Analyzer
[Go to lesson](Go-Tools-Log-Analyzer.md)

A log analyzer processes and extracts meaningful insights from large log files. You will:
- Design a system to parse logs from various formats (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or custom).
- Implement filters and aggregations to summarize log data.
- Add features to detect anomalies and visualize patterns.

This project will equip you with skills to handle high-volume data and provide actionable insights for debugging and monitoring.

### 3. File Compressor
[Go to lesson](Go-Tools-File-Compressor.md)

File compression reduces storage needs and speeds up file transfers. In this module, you will:
- Build a utility to compress and decompress files using algorithms like Gzip or LZW.
- Optimize the system for speed and compression ratio.
- Add support for batch processing and error handling.

By completing this project, you will understand the fundamentals of data compression and file handling.

### 4. Task Scheduler
[Go to lesson](Go-Tools-Task-Scheduler.md)

A task scheduler automates recurring tasks with precision and reliability. In this module, you will:
- Build a scheduler to execute tasks based on cron-like expressions.
- Add support for periodic, delayed, and conditional task execution.
- Implement logging and monitoring for task statuses.

This project will teach you how to manage time-based operations efficiently, a critical aspect of system automation.

---

### 5. Text Processor
[Go to lesson](Go-Tools-Text-Processor.md)

A text processor simplifies the handling of large text files. You will:
- Build a utility to search, replace, and format text efficiently.
- Add support for handling regular expressions and multi-file operations.
- Include features for summarization, sorting, and filtering.

This project will help you master text manipulation techniques essential for data cleaning and preprocessing tasks.
