# 100

HTTP status code 100 indicates that the initial part of a request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The client should continue with the request or ignore the response if the request is already finished.

To handle a 100 status code in PHP, you can set the HTTP response code. Here is an example:

```php
<?php
// Set the HTTP response code to 100
http_response_code(100);

// Display a message indicating that the client should continue
echo 'Continue with the request.';
```

This code sets the HTTP response code to 100 and displays a message indicating that the client should continue with the request. This informs the client that the initial part of the request has been received and has not been rejected by the server.

When encountering a 100 status code, the client can proceed with the request or ignore the response if the request is already finished. This status code is used to indicate that the server has received the initial part of the request and is ready for the client to continue with the rest of the request.
