# 200

HTTP status code 200 indicates that the request has succeeded. The information returned with the response is dependent on the method used in the request.

To handle a 200 status code in PHP, you can set the HTTP response code and display a success message. Here is an example:

```php
<?php
// Set the HTTP response code to 200
http_response_code(200);

// Display a success message
echo 'Request succeeded.';
```

This code sets the HTTP response code to 200 and displays a message indicating that the request was successful. This informs the client that the request has been processed and the response contains the requested information.

When encountering a 200 status code, the client can proceed with processing the response data. This status code is commonly used for successful requests and indicates that the server has successfully processed the request.
