# 400

HTTP status code 400 indicates that the server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax. This status code is used when the server cannot process the request because of a client error.

To handle a 400 status code in PHP, you can set the HTTP response code and display an error message. Here is an example:

```php
<?php
// Set the HTTP response code to 400
http_response_code(400);

// Display an error message
echo 'Bad Request: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.';
```

This code sets the HTTP response code to 400 and displays a message indicating that the request was invalid. You can customize the error message to provide more specific information about the error.

When a client receives a 400 status code, it should review the request and correct any errors before resubmitting it to the server. This status code helps in identifying and resolving issues related to client-side errors in the request syntax.
