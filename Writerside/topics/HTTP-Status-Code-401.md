# 401

HTTP status code 401 indicates that the request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource. This status code is used when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.

To handle a 401 status code in PHP, you can set the HTTP response code and display an error message. Here is an example:

```php
<?php
// Set the HTTP response code to 401
http_response_code(401);

// Display an error message
echo 'Unauthorized: Authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.';
```

This code sets the HTTP response code to 401 and displays a message indicating that authentication is required.
