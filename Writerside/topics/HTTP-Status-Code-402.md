# 402

HTTP status code 402 indicates that payment is required. This status code is reserved for future use and is not currently used by any HTTP/1.1 applications.

To handle a 402 status code in PHP, you can set the HTTP response code and display an error message. Here is an example:

```php
<?php
// Set the HTTP response code to 402
http_response_code(402);

// Display an error message
echo 'Payment Required: Payment is required to access this resource.';
```
