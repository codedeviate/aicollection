# 403

HTTP status code 403 indicates that the server understands the request but refuses to authorize it. This status code is used when the server denies access to the requested resource.

To handle a 403 status code in PHP, you can set the HTTP response code and display an error message. Here is an example:

```php
<?php
// Set the HTTP response code to 403
http_response_code(403);

// Display an error message
echo 'Forbidden: You do not have permission to access this resource.';
```

This code sets the HTTP response code to 403 and displays a message indicating that access to the resource is forbidden. You can customize the error message to provide more specific information about the denial of access.

When a client receives a 403 status code, it should review the access permissions and credentials required to access the resource. This status code helps in identifying and resolving issues related to unauthorized access to resources on the server.
