# 429

HTTP status code 429 indicates that the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting"). This is typically used to prevent abuse or overloading of the server.

To handle a 429 status code in PHP, you can set the HTTP response code and display a message indicating that the user should try again later. Here is an example:

```php
<?php
// Set the HTTP response code to 429
http_response_code(429);

// Display a rate limiting message
echo 'Too many requests. Please try again later.';
```

This code sets the HTTP response code to 429 and displays a message indicating that the user has sent too many requests and should try again later. This informs the client that they have exceeded the rate limit and need to slow down their requests.

When encountering a 429 status code, it is recommended to wait for some time before retrying the request to avoid being blocked by the server. This status code is commonly used to enforce rate limits and prevent abuse of the server's resources.
