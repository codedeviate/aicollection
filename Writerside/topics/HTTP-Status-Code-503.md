# 503

HTTP status code 503 indicates that the server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. This is a temporary condition and the server should be able to handle the request after some time.

To handle a 503 status code in PHP, you can set the HTTP response code and display a maintenance message. Here is an example:

```php
<?php
// Set the HTTP response code to 503
http_response_code(503);

// Display a maintenance message
echo 'The server is currently undergoing maintenance. Please try again later.';
```

This code sets the HTTP response code to 503 and displays a message indicating that the server is undergoing maintenance. This informs the client that the server is temporarily unavailable and to try again later.

When encountering a 503 status code, it is recommended to retry the request after some time to allow the server to recover. This status code is commonly used to indicate temporary server issues and is not a permanent error condition.
