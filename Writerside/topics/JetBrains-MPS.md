# MPS

MPS (Meta Programming System) is an integrated development environment (IDE) developed by JetBrains. It is designed to support the creation of domain-specific languages (DSLs) and provides a comprehensive set of tools for language development, code generation, and language composition.

## Key Features

### Language Development
- **Language Definition**: Allows defining new languages with custom syntax, semantics, and editor support.
- **Language Composition**: Supports composing multiple languages together to create complex DSLs.
- **Code Generation**: Provides tools for generating code from DSLs to various target languages.

### Editor Support
- **Projectional Editing**: Uses projectional editing to allow flexible and powerful language editors.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Supports syntax highlighting for custom languages.
- **Code Completion**: Offers smart code completion for custom languages.

### Model-Based Development
- **Abstract Syntax Trees**: Uses abstract syntax trees (ASTs) to represent code structures.
- **Model Transformations**: Supports model-to-model transformations for code generation and analysis.
- **Refactoring**: Provides refactoring tools for custom languages.

### Integration and Extensibility
- **IDE Integration**: Integrates with JetBrains IDEs for a seamless development experience.
- **Plugins**: Supports a wide range of plugins to extend functionality.
- **API Access**: Provides APIs for integrating with other tools and systems.

### Collaboration (Feature)
- **Version Control Integration**: Integrates with version control systems like Git for collaborative development.
- **Shared Models**: Allows sharing models and languages with team members.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Supports real-time collaboration on language development and model editing.

### Testing and Debugging
- **Unit Testing**: Provides tools for unit testing custom languages and transformations.
- **Debugger**: Includes a debugger for custom languages with support for breakpoints and step-by-step execution.
- **Test Coverage**: Displays test coverage information to ensure comprehensive testing.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Language Development Efficiency
- **Language Definition Time**: Average time taken to define new languages.
- **Code Generation Speed**: Average time taken to generate code from DSLs.
- **Model Transformation Time**: Time taken to perform model-to-model transformations.

### Code Quality
- **Error-Free Code**: Percentage of code free from syntax and semantic errors.
- **Refactoring Time**: Time saved using automated refactoring tools.
- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by automated tests.

### Collaboration (MPS)
- **Commit Frequency**: Number of commits made per day/week.
- **Merge Conflict Resolution Time**: Average time taken to resolve merge conflicts.
- **Shared Model Usage**: Number of shared models used in collaborative development.

### User Satisfaction
- **User Feedback**: Ratings and feedback from developers using MPS.
- **Adoption Rate**: Percentage of developers adopting MPS in their workflow.
- **Support Requests**: Number of support requests and resolution time.

MPS is designed to enhance productivity and collaboration for language developers, offering a comprehensive set of tools and features tailored to the needs of modern language development and model-based development.
