# Conditions and operators

*In-Depth Exploration of SQL Conditions and Operators*

SQL conditions and operators are foundational elements in query construction. They enable you to filter, compare, and manipulate data by specifying precise criteria in your SQL statements. This article offers a comprehensive look at the various conditions and operators available in SQL, complete with practical examples and best practices to help you craft efficient, effective queries.

## 1. Understanding SQL Conditions and Operators

Conditions in SQL are used to limit and specify the data returned by a query. They are typically included in the `WHERE` clause, but can also be used in other clauses (such as `HAVING` and `JOIN`). Operators are the building blocks of these conditions, providing the means to compare values, match patterns, and combine multiple criteria.

### Key Categories of Operators

- **Logical Operators:** Combine multiple conditions.
- **Comparison Operators:** Compare values.
- **Pattern Matching Operators:** Search for specific patterns in text.
- **NULL Checking Operators:** Identify missing or undefined data.
- **Range and List Operators:** Specify ranges or sets of values.

---

## 2. Logical Operators

Logical operators allow you to combine multiple conditions into a single, complex condition.

### 2.1. AND

- **Purpose:** Combines two conditions and returns true only if both conditions are true.
- **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees
  WHERE department = 'Sales' AND hire_date >= '2023-01-01';
  ```

  *This query returns employees who work in Sales and were hired on or after January 1, 2023.*

### 2.2. OR

- **Purpose:** Returns true if at least one of the conditions is true.
- **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees
  WHERE department = 'Sales' OR department = 'Marketing';
  ```

  *This query retrieves employees who work in either Sales or Marketing.*

### 2.3. NOT

- **Purpose:** Negates a condition, returning true if the condition is false.
- **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees
  WHERE NOT department = 'HR';
  ```

  *This query selects employees who are not in the HR department.*

## 3. Comparison Operators

Comparison operators allow you to compare two values or expressions.

### 3.1. Equal To (=)

- **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM products
  WHERE price = 19.99;
  ```

  *This query selects products priced exactly at 19.99.*

### 3.2. Not Equal To (<> or !=)

- **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM products
  WHERE price <> 19.99;
  ```

  *This query returns products with a price other than 19.99.*

### 3.3. Greater Than (>) and Less Than (<)

- **Examples:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM orders
  WHERE amount > 100;
  ```

  *This query returns orders with an amount greater than 100.*

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM orders
  WHERE amount < 50;
  ```

  *This query retrieves orders with an amount less than 50.*

### 3.4. Greater Than or Equal To (>=) and Less Than or Equal To (<=)

- **Examples:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM orders
  WHERE amount >= 100;
  ```

  *This query selects orders with an amount of 100 or more.*

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM orders
  WHERE amount <= 50;
  ```

  *This query fetches orders with an amount of 50 or less.*

## 4. Pattern Matching Operators

Pattern matching operators are particularly useful for filtering string data.

### 4.1. LIKE

- **Purpose:** Matches a pattern within a string using wildcard characters.
- **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM customers
  WHERE customer_name LIKE 'A%';
  ```

  *This query returns customers whose names start with the letter "A".*

### 4.2. NOT LIKE

- **Purpose:** Excludes rows matching a specified pattern.
- **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM customers
  WHERE customer_name NOT LIKE '%Inc';
  ```

  *This query retrieves customers whose names do not end with "Inc".*

---

## 5. NULL Checking Operators

Handling NULL values is critical in SQL, as NULL represents missing or unknown data.

### 5.1. IS NULL

- **Purpose:** Checks if a value is NULL.
- **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM orders
  WHERE delivery_date IS NULL;
  ```

  *This query returns orders that have not yet been assigned a delivery date.*

### 5.2. IS NOT NULL

- **Purpose:** Checks if a value is not NULL.
- **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM orders
  WHERE delivery_date IS NOT NULL;
  ```

  *This query fetches orders that have a delivery date specified.*

---

## 6. Range and List Operators

Range and list operators allow you to define a set or a range of values.

### 6.1. BETWEEN

- **Purpose:** Selects values within a specified range.
- **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM products
  WHERE price BETWEEN 10 AND 50;
  ```

  *This query selects products priced between 10 and 50.*

### 6.2. NOT BETWEEN

- **Purpose:** Selects values outside a specified range.
- **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM products
  WHERE price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 50;
  ```

  *This query returns products with a price not in the range of 10 to 50.*

### 6.3. IN

- **Purpose:** Checks if a value matches any value in a list.
- **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees
  WHERE department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing', 'HR');
  ```

  *This query selects employees who work in Sales, Marketing, or HR.*

### 6.4. NOT IN

- **Purpose:** Checks if a value does not match any value in a list.
- **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees
  WHERE department NOT IN ('Sales', 'Marketing');
  ```

  *This query returns employees who are not in Sales or Marketing.*

## 7. Practical Examples of Conditions and Operators

### Example 1: Filtering Employee Records

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE (department = 'Finance' OR department = 'Accounting')
  AND hire_date >= '2022-01-01'
  AND salary > 50000;
```

*This query returns employees in Finance or Accounting who were hired after January 1, 2022, and have a salary greater than 50,000.*

### Example 2: Finding Specific Product Patterns

```sql
SELECT product_id, product_name
FROM products
WHERE product_name LIKE '%pct%Pro%pct%'
  AND price BETWEEN 100 AND 500;
```

*This query selects products containing "Pro" in their name and priced between 100 and 500.*

### Example 3: Excluding Unwanted Data

```sql
SELECT customer_id, customer_name
FROM customers
WHERE email IS NOT NULL
  AND customer_name NOT LIKE '%pct%Test%pct%';
```

*This query retrieves customer details excluding entries with NULL emails and names containing "Test".*

## 8. Best Practices for Using Conditions and Operators

- **Use Parentheses for Clarity:**  
  Group conditions logically using parentheses to ensure the intended order of evaluation.

- **Be Mindful of NULLs:**  
  Always check for NULLs when necessary, as they can affect the outcome of comparisons.

- **Optimize for Performance:**  
  Ensure that columns used in conditions are indexed where appropriate, to improve query performance.

- **Test Complex Conditions:**  
  Validate your conditions with sample data to ensure they return the expected results.

- **Keep Readability in Mind:**  
  Use clear, descriptive column names and consistent formatting to make your queries easier to understand and maintain.
