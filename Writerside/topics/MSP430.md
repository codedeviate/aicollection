# MSP430

## History
The MSP430 is a family of microcontrollers from Texas Instruments, introduced in the 1990s. It is known for its ultra-low power consumption, making it ideal for battery-operated devices. The MSP430 series is widely used in various applications, including industrial, automotive, and consumer electronics.

## Features
- **16-bit architecture**: Processes 16 bits of data at a time.
- **Ultra-low power**: Designed for low power consumption, suitable for battery-powered applications.
- **Rich peripheral set**: Includes ADCs, DACs, timers, and communication interfaces.
- **Flexible clock system**: Allows for various clock sources and configurations.
- **In-system programmable flash memory**: Enables easy updates and modifications to the firmware.

## Example Code
Here is a simple MSP430 C program to blink an LED:

```c
#include <msp430.h>

void main(void) {
    WDTCTL = WDTPW | WDTHOLD; // Stop watchdog timer
    P1DIR |= BIT0; // Set P1.0 as output
    while (1) {
        P1OUT ^= BIT0; // Toggle P1.0
        __delay_cycles(500000); // Delay
    }
}
```

This code configures the MSP430 to toggle an LED connected to pin P1.0 with a delay, creating a blinking effect.
