## The History of Linux

### The Beginnings
Linux was born in 1991 when Linus Torvalds, a computer science student at the University of Helsinki, sought to create a free and open-source alternative to the proprietary UNIX operating system. Inspired by MINIX, a teaching-oriented UNIX clone, Torvalds initially released the Linux kernel under a restrictive license. Shortly after, he re-licensed it under the GNU General Public License (GPL), enabling collaboration and modification by the global developer community.

### The Rise of Open Source
Linux’s alignment with the GNU Project’s philosophy of free software catalyzed its growth. The GNU tools, developed by Richard Stallman and others, provided the essential utilities needed for a fully functional operating system. Combined with the Linux kernel, this ecosystem became known as the GNU/Linux operating system.

### Key Milestones
- **1994:** The release of Linux kernel version 1.0 marked its transition from a hobbyist project to a legitimate operating system.
- **1998:** Major corporations like IBM and Oracle announced support for Linux, lending it credibility in enterprise environments.
- **2003:** The launch of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) established Linux as a robust platform for business.
- **2008:** Android, based on the Linux kernel, debuted and revolutionized the mobile industry.
