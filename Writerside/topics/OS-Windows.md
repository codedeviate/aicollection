## The History of DOS

### The Birth of MS-DOS
MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) was introduced in 1981. Originally developed as QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System) by Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products, it was purchased by Microsoft for use on IBM’s first personal computers. This partnership propelled MS-DOS to widespread adoption.

### Key Features of MS-DOS
- **Command-Line Interface:** Users interacted with the system through text commands.
- **Lightweight and Fast:** MS-DOS was efficient, requiring minimal hardware resources.
- **File System:** Introduced the FAT (File Allocation Table) system, which became a foundation for early PC storage.

### Legacy and Impact
MS-DOS dominated the PC market throughout the 1980s, becoming a standard for software development. Its simplicity and flexibility allowed a wide range of applications, laying the groundwork for future graphical operating systems.

## The Transition to Windows

### Windows 1.0 (1985)
Microsoft launched Windows 1.0 as a graphical extension of MS-DOS, featuring a rudimentary GUI. Although not a commercial success, it introduced concepts like windows, menus, and icons.

### Key Milestones
- **Windows 3.x (1990):** Marked the first widely successful version, featuring improved multitasking and a more intuitive interface.
- **Windows 95 (1995):** A groundbreaking release, introducing the Start menu, taskbar, and plug-and-play hardware support. It merged MS-DOS with a modern GUI.
- **Windows XP (2001):** Known for its stability and user-friendly interface, XP became one of the most popular versions of Windows.
- **Windows 7 (2009):** Focused on usability and performance, addressing issues from Windows Vista.
- **Windows 10 (2015):** Unified the Windows ecosystem across devices with regular updates.
- **Windows 11 (2021):** Introduced a refreshed design and features optimized for productivity and modern hardware.
