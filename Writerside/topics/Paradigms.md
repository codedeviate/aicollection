# Paradigms

## What are Programming Paradigms?

Programming paradigms are fundamental styles or approaches to programming that provide a framework for how to structure and write code. Each paradigm offers a different way to think about and solve problems, and they often influence the design and implementation of programming languages.

## Common Programming Paradigms

### Procedural Programming

Procedural programming is a paradigm that focuses on procedures or routines to perform tasks. It is based on the concept of calling procedures, which are also known as functions or subroutines. This paradigm emphasizes a clear sequence of steps to achieve a desired outcome.

- **Examples**: C, Pascal

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-oriented programming organizes code into objects that contain data and methods. This paradigm is based on the concepts of classes and objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. OOP aims to model real-world entities and their interactions.

- **Examples**: Java, C++, Python

### Functional Programming

Functional programming emphasizes the use of functions and immutability. It treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. This paradigm promotes a declarative style of programming.

- **Examples**: Haskell, Lisp

### Scripting Languages

Scripting languages are used for automating tasks and writing quick scripts. They are often interpreted rather than compiled and are designed to be easy to write and execute.

- **Examples**: JavaScript, Python, Ruby

## Conclusion

Understanding different programming paradigms helps developers choose the right approach for a given problem and leverage the strengths of each paradigm. By exploring procedural, object-oriented, functional, and scripting paradigms, you can enhance your programming skills and create more efficient and maintainable code.
