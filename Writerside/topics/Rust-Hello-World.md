# Hello, World

Here is a simple "Hello World" program in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

## Steps to Compile and Build

1. **Save the code**: Save the above code in a file named `main.rs`.

2. **Open a terminal**: Navigate to the directory where `main.rs` is saved.

3. **Compile the code**: Use the `rustc` compiler to compile the code. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   rustc main.rs
   ```

4. **Run the executable**: After compilation, an executable file named `main` (or `main.exe` on Windows) will be created. Run it using:
   ```sh
   ./main
   ```

This will output:
```
Hello, World!
```
