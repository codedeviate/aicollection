# Rust

This section contains snippets of code written in Rust, a systems programming language known for its performance, safety, and concurrency. Rust is designed to provide memory safety without using a garbage collector, making it ideal for system-level programming, web assembly, and other performance-critical applications. The following examples demonstrate various Rust functionalities and best practices to help you understand and implement Rust in your projects effectively.

## History

The Rust programming language was developed by Mozilla Research. Here is a brief history:

- **2010**: Graydon Hoare begins working on Rust as a personal project.
- **2010**: Mozilla begins sponsoring the project.
- **2012**: The first pre-alpha release of Rust is made available.
- **2015**: Rust 1.0 is officially released, marking the first stable release of the language.
- **2016**: Rust 1.8 introduces the `cargo` package manager, which becomes a central part of the Rust ecosystem.
- **2018**: Rust 1.26 introduces the `impl Trait` feature, simplifying the syntax for returning complex types.
- **2019**: Rust 1.36 introduces the `Future` trait, paving the way for asynchronous programming.
- **2020**: Rust 1.45 introduces support for the `const fn` feature, allowing more functions to be evaluated at compile time.
- **2021**: Rust 1.51 introduces the `const generics` feature, allowing more flexible and powerful generic programming.

Rust continues to evolve, with ongoing work to improve the language and add new features.
