# OUTER JOIN

## **SQL OUTER JOIN: Comprehensive Explanation**

An **OUTER JOIN** retrieves matching rows from two tables and also includes non-matching rows from one or both tables, depending on the type of OUTER JOIN used. It is useful for finding data that exists in one table but not the other.

There are three types of **OUTER JOINs**:

1. **LEFT OUTER JOIN** (or simply `LEFT JOIN`): Includes all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If no match is found in the right table, `NULL` is returned for those columns.
2. **RIGHT OUTER JOIN** (or simply `RIGHT JOIN`): Includes all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. If no match is found in the left table, `NULL` is returned for those columns.
3. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Combines the results of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`. Includes all rows from both tables, with `NULL` for non-matching rows.

## **Syntax**
### LEFT JOIN:
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

### RIGHT JOIN:
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

### FULL OUTER JOIN:
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

## **Example Scenario**
We will use two tables:

**1. `Customers` Table:**
| CustomerID | Name        | Country  |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| 1          | Alice       | USA      |
| 2          | Bob         | Canada   |
| 3          | Charlie     | UK       |
| 4          | David       | Germany  |

**2. `Orders` Table:**
| OrderID | CustomerID | Product      |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| 101     | 1          | Laptop       |
| 102     | 2          | Tablet       |
| 103     | 1          | Smartphone   |
| 104     | 5          | Monitor      |

## **1. LEFT OUTER JOIN**
Query to retrieve all customers and their orders, even if some customers have not placed any orders:
```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerID, Customers.Name, Orders.Product
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

**Result:**
| CustomerID | Name     | Product     |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 1          | Alice    | Laptop      |
| 1          | Alice    | Smartphone  |
| 2          | Bob      | Tablet      |
| 3          | Charlie  | NULL        |
| 4          | David    | NULL        |

**Explanation:**
- Rows for Charlie (`CustomerID = 3`) and David (`CustomerID = 4`) are included even though they have no matching orders. `NULL` is used for the `Product` column where there is no match.

## **2. RIGHT OUTER JOIN**
Query to retrieve all orders and their associated customers, even if some orders were placed by non-existent customers:
```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.Product, Customers.Name
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Customers
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

**Result:**
| OrderID | Product     | Name     |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| 101     | Laptop      | Alice    |
| 103     | Smartphone  | Alice    |
| 102     | Tablet      | Bob      |
| NULL    | NULL        | Charlie  |
| NULL    | NULL        | David    |

**Explanation:**
- Orders placed by non-existent customers (like `OrderID = 104` with `CustomerID = 5`) are excluded because the right table (Customers) takes precedence.
- Customers without orders (like Charlie and David) are included, with `NULL` for `OrderID` and `Product`.

---

## **3. FULL OUTER JOIN**
Query to retrieve all customers and orders, including unmatched rows from both tables:
```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerID, Customers.Name, Orders.OrderID, Orders.Product
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

**Result:**
| CustomerID | Name     | OrderID | Product     |
|------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| 1          | Alice    | 101     | Laptop      |
| 1          | Alice    | 103     | Smartphone  |
| 2          | Bob      | 102     | Tablet      |
| 3          | Charlie  | NULL    | NULL        |
| 4          | David    | NULL    | NULL        |
| NULL       | NULL     | 104     | Monitor     |

**Explanation:**
- Combines the results of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`.
- Includes all customers and all orders, even if there is no match.
- `NULL` is used for missing values.

## **Comparison of Outer Joins**
| Join Type      | Included Rows                                                                                             |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LEFT JOIN**  | All rows from the left table, plus matching rows from the right table. Non-matching right rows are `NULL`.|
| **RIGHT JOIN** | All rows from the right table, plus matching rows from the left table. Non-matching left rows are `NULL`. |
| **FULL JOIN**  | All rows from both tables, with `NULL` for non-matching rows on either side.                              |

## **Key Points**
1. **Performance Considerations**:
    - Outer joins can be slower than inner joins because they process additional rows (non-matching ones).
2. **Use Cases**:
    - `LEFT JOIN`: Retrieve all data from one table, regardless of matches in the other.
    - `RIGHT JOIN`: Useful when you want all data from the second table regardless of matches.
    - `FULL JOIN`: When you need a complete view of matching and non-matching rows from both tables.
