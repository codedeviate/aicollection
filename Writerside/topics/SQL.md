# SQL

This section contains snippets of code written in SQL, a standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL is widely used for querying, updating, and managing data in database systems. The following examples demonstrate various SQL functionalities and best practices to help you understand and implement SQL in your projects effectively.

## History

The SQL (Structured Query Language) was developed for managing and manipulating relational databases. Here is a brief history:

- **1970**: Edgar F. Codd, a computer scientist at IBM, publishes a paper on the relational model for database management, which lays the foundation for SQL.
- **1974**: Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce at IBM develop SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's original relational database prototype, System R.
- **1979**: Relational Software, Inc. (now Oracle Corporation) releases the first commercial implementation of SQL, called Oracle V2.
- **1986**: The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) adopts SQL as a standard, known as SQL-86 or SQL-87.
- **1989**: The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopts the SQL standard, making it an international standard.
- **1992**: The SQL-92 standard is released, introducing new features and enhancements to the language.
- **1999**: The SQL:1999 standard is released, adding support for object-relational database management systems (ORDBMS) and other new features.
- **2003**: The SQL:2003 standard is released, introducing XML-related features and window functions.
- **2008**: The SQL:2008 standard is released, adding new features such as the MERGE statement and improved support for temporal databases.
- **2011**: The SQL:2011 standard is released, introducing new features for temporal databases and other enhancements.
- **2016**: The SQL:2016 standard is released, adding support for JSON and other new features.

SQL continues to evolve, with ongoing work to improve the language and add new features.
