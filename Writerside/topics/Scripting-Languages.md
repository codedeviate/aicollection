# Scripting Language Programming

## What is Scripting Language Programming?

Scripting language programming involves writing scripts, which are programs written for a special runtime environment that can automate the execution of tasks. Scripting languages are often interpreted rather than compiled and are used to write short programs that automate repetitive tasks.

## Key Characteristics of Scripting Languages

1. **Interpreted**: Scripting languages are typically interpreted, meaning they are executed line-by-line by an interpreter.
2. **Dynamic Typing**: Variables in scripting languages are often dynamically typed, meaning their type is determined at runtime.
3. **Ease of Use**: Scripting languages are designed to be easy to write and understand, often with simpler syntax compared to compiled languages.
4. **Rapid Development**: Scripts can be written and tested quickly, making them ideal for automating tasks and prototyping.

## Common Scripting Languages

- **Python**: Widely used for web development, automation, data analysis, and more.
- **JavaScript**: Primarily used for web development to create interactive web pages.
- **Ruby**: Known for its simplicity and productivity, often used in web development.
- **Bash**: Used for writing scripts to automate tasks in Unix-based operating systems.

## Example of a Scripting Language

Here is a simple example in Python that demonstrates scripting by automating the task of renaming files in a directory:

```python
import os

def rename_files(directory, prefix):
    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        new_name = prefix + filename
        os.rename(os.path.join(directory, filename), os.path.join(directory, new_name))

# Usage
directory_path = "/path/to/directory"
file_prefix = "new_"
rename_files(directory_path, file_prefix)
```

In this example:
- The `rename_files` function takes a directory path and a prefix as arguments.
- It iterates over all files in the directory and renames each file by adding the prefix to its name.
- The `os` module is used to interact with the file system.
