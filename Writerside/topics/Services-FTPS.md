# FTPS

FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension to the commonly used File Transfer Protocol (FTP) that adds support for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) cryptographic protocols. FTPS allows FTP to securely encrypt the control and data channels, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data being transferred.

## Key Concepts of FTPS

- **Client-Server Model**: FTPS operates on a client-server model where the client initiates a connection to the server to transfer files.
- **Secure Connection**: FTPS uses TLS/SSL to encrypt both the command and data channels, ensuring secure file transfer.
- **Authentication**: FTPS requires authentication, typically using a username and password, and can also support client certificates.
- **Explicit and Implicit Modes**: FTPS can operate in explicit mode (where the client explicitly requests security from the server) or implicit mode (where the client connects to a secure port).

## FTPS Commands

FTPS uses the same commands as FTP, with the addition of commands to manage the secure connection:

- **AUTH**: Initiates a secure connection using TLS/SSL.
- **PBSZ**: Sets the size of the protection buffer.
- **PROT**: Sets the protection level for the data channel.

## FTPS Responses

FTPS uses the same response codes as FTP, with additional codes for secure connection management:

- **234**: Indicates that the server accepts the AUTH command and is ready to negotiate a secure connection.
- **334**: Indicates that the server is waiting for the client to send authentication information.
- **631**: Indicates that the server has successfully negotiated a secure connection.

## Example: Uploading and Downloading Files Using Python's ftplib with TLS

Here is an example of uploading and downloading files using Python's `ftplib` library with TLS:

```python
import ftplib

# FTPS server configuration
ftps_server = 'ftps.example.com'
ftps_user = 'your_username'
ftps_password = 'your_password'

# Connect to the server
ftps = ftplib.FTP_TLS(ftps_server)
ftps.login(user=ftps_user, passwd=ftps_password)
ftps.prot_p()  # Secure the data connection

# Upload a file
filename = 'upload.txt'
with open(filename, 'rb') as file:
    ftps.storbinary(f'STOR {filename}', file)

# Download a file
filename = 'download.txt'
with open(filename, 'wb') as file:
    ftps.retrbinary(f'RETR {filename}', file.write)

# List files in the current directory
ftps.retrlines('LIST')

# Logout and close the connection
ftps.quit()
```

## Relevant Switches and Parameters

### Common `ftplib.FTP_TLS` Methods
- `FTP_TLS(server)`: Connects to the FTPS server.
- `login(user, passwd)`: Authenticates with the FTPS server.
- `prot_p()`: Secures the data connection using TLS.
- `storbinary(cmd, file)`: Uploads a file in binary mode.
- `retrbinary(cmd, callback)`: Downloads a file in binary mode.
- `retrlines(cmd)`: Retrieves a list of files and directories.
- `quit()`: Ends the session.

Understanding FTPS and its associated commands and responses is crucial for implementing and troubleshooting secure file transfer services.
