# Hello, World

> *Bash is used in this example, but many other shell scripting languages can be used to create a "Hello, world!" program. The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the basic syntax and structure of a simple script in a shell scripting language.*

Here is a simple Bash script to print "Hello, world!":

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!"
```

Save this script to a file, for example, `hello.sh`, and make it executable with the following command:

```bash
chmod +x hello.sh
```

Then, you can run the script using:

```bash
./hello.sh
```
