# Shell

A shell is a command-line interface (CLI) used to interact with the operating system. It allows users to execute commands, run scripts, and manage system resources. Shells can be either command-line based or graphical. The most common types of shells are:

1. **Bourne Shell (sh)**: The original Unix shell developed by Stephen Bourne.
2. **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)**: An enhanced version of the Bourne Shell, widely used in Linux and macOS.
3. **C Shell (csh)**: A Unix shell with C-like syntax, developed by Bill Joy.
4. **Korn Shell (ksh)**: A Unix shell developed by David Korn, combining features of the Bourne Shell and C Shell.
5. **Z Shell (zsh)**: An extended Bourne Shell with many improvements and features.

Shells provide various functionalities, including:

- **Command Execution**: Running system commands and applications.
- **Scripting**: Writing and executing shell scripts to automate tasks.
- **Environment Management**: Setting and managing environment variables.
- **File Manipulation**: Creating, deleting, and modifying files and directories.
- **Process Control**: Managing running processes and jobs.

Shells are essential tools for system administrators, developers, and power users to efficiently manage and automate system tasks.
