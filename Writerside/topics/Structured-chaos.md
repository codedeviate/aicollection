# Structured Chaos

This collection of documents began as a simple compilation of things I’ve learned and found useful along my journey. At
first, I thought it would just be a small, personal archive, a way to organize my thoughts and share what I’ve picked up.
But as I started writing, I quickly realized that the topics I wanted to cover were far more expansive than I initially
anticipated. Some were far more intricate and layered, while others had nuances I hadn't fully considered.

As I explored these subjects further, I realized there was a valuable opportunity to build something more
educational—something that could offer insight and clarity to others seeking to learn about these topics. I didn’t want
this to be just a personal collection, but rather a resource that could potentially help others grasp these ideas more
effectively.

And so, I decided to create what I now call a *structured chaos*. The idea is simple: a collection of documents that are
semi-structured, where topics are presented with some order, but still with room for exploration. This semi-structure
allows for complexity and depth, but with a touch of unpredictability—a space where ideas might evolve and take
surprising turns. This chaotic element mirrors the way we often approach learning: sometimes things are neat and clear,
other times they’re a bit messy or unexpectedly profound.

I do hope that you’ll forgive me if you come across inconsistencies, or if you feel some topics are either too complex
or too simplistic. As I continue to expand this collection, I’m working hard to ensure that it remains as useful and
clear as possible, while also growing my own skills in writing and communication.

Whenever possible, the code and projects I reference will be available in a public Git repository. I hope that by making
these resources accessible, you can follow along, experiment, or perhaps find some inspiration to create your own
projects.

While much of the content is drawn from my own experience and knowledge, I also strive to research and dive deeper into
each subject. The goal is for this collection to evolve over time, becoming more refined and comprehensive with each new
update.

I’d like to extend a special thank you to tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, which have helped me improve the
clarity and structure of these documents. As English is not my first language, I’m always striving to improve my ability
to communicate, and these tools have been invaluable in that process.
