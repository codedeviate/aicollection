# TDD

## What is TDD?

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where tests are written before the actual code. The primary goal of TDD is to ensure that the code meets its requirements and behaves as expected. TDD follows a repetitive cycle of writing a test, writing code to pass the test, and then refactoring the code.

## Key Principles of TDD

1. **Write a Test**: Before writing any functional code, write a test that defines a new function or improvement.
2. **Run the Test**: Run the test to see it fail. This step ensures that the test is valid and that the feature is not already implemented.
3. **Write Code**: Write the minimum amount of code necessary to pass the test.
4. **Run the Test Again**: Run the test to see it pass. If the test passes, it confirms that the code meets the requirements.
5. **Refactor**: Refactor the code to improve its structure and readability while ensuring that it still passes the test.
6. **Repeat**: Repeat the cycle for each new feature or improvement.

## Benefits of TDD

- **Improved Code Quality**: Writing tests first ensures that the code is thoroughly tested and meets the requirements.
- **Reduced Bugs**: Early detection of issues through testing reduces the number of bugs in the final product.
- **Better Design**: TDD encourages writing small, modular, and maintainable code.
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as documentation for the code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

## Example of TDD Cycle

1. **Write a Test**:
    ```python
    def test_addition():
        assert add(2, 3) == 5
    ```

2. **Run the Test**:
    ```sh
    $ pytest test_addition.py
    ```

3. **Write Code**:
    ```python
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b
    ```

4. **Run the Test Again**:
    ```sh
    $ pytest test_addition.py
    ```

5. **Refactor**:
    ```python
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b  # Code is already simple and clear
    ```

6. **Repeat**: Continue the cycle for additional features or improvements.

## Conclusion

TDD is a powerful methodology that helps ensure code quality, reduce bugs, and improve design. By writing tests before code, developers can create more reliable and maintainable software.
