## Core Features of ARC

- **Browser-Based Application:** ARC runs directly in your browser (or as a Chrome app), making it easily accessible across different platforms.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** With a minimalistic design, ARC helps you focus on building and sending requests without unnecessary distractions.
- **Support for Multiple HTTP Methods:** Send requests using GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, and other HTTP methods.
- **Custom Headers and Query Parameters:** Easily add headers and query parameters to customize your API calls.
- **Response Visualization:** View responses in raw text, JSON, or other formats, complete with syntax highlighting.
- **Request History and Collections:** Keep track of your requests with a built-in history feature and organize them into collections for future reference.
- **Cross-Origin Support:** ARC handles CORS issues, making it convenient for testing APIs during development.

## Getting Started with ARC

### Installation and Setup

1. **Access ARC:**  
   ARC is available as a web app at the [Advanced REST Client website](https://arc.app/) or as a Chrome application. Choose the option that best suits your workflow.

2. **Launch the Application:**  
   Once you access ARC, you will be greeted with a simple and intuitive interface that allows you to start building API requests immediately.

3. **Familiarize Yourself with the Interface:**  
   The main interface is divided into sections for request configuration, response display, and request history. This setup ensures you can quickly iterate through different API calls.

### Creating Your First Request

1. **New Request:**  
   Click on the **“New Request”** button to begin.

2. **Enter Request Details:**
    - **Method:** Choose the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST).
    - **URL:** Enter the API endpoint (for example, `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`).

3. **Send the Request:**  
   Click **“Send”** to execute the request and view the response in the response panel.

## Examples of Using ARC

### Basic GET and POST Requests

#### GET Request Example

To fetch a list of posts from a sample API:

- **URL:** `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`
- **Method:** GET

**Steps:**

1. Open ARC and create a new GET request.
2. Enter the URL and click **“Send”**.
3. Review the formatted JSON response in the response viewer.

#### POST Request Example

To create a new post, set up a POST request with the following details:

- **URL:** `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`
- **Method:** POST
- **Headers:**
    - `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "title": "ARC API Guide",
    "body": "This post demonstrates how to use Advanced REST Client for API testing.",
    "userId": 1
  }
  ```

**Steps:**

1. Select POST and input the URL.
2. In the Headers section, add the `Content-Type` header.
3. Paste the JSON payload in the Body section.
4. Click **“Send”** to see the response confirming the creation of the new post.

### Working with Headers and Query Parameters

ARC allows you to easily add custom headers and query parameters:

- **Custom Headers:**  
  Use the headers panel to add authorization tokens or other necessary headers.

- **Query Parameters:**  
  Add query parameters directly within ARC's interface, so you don’t have to manually alter the URL.

### Saving and Organizing Requests

- **History:**  
  ARC automatically saves your recent requests, making it easy to revisit them later.

- **Collections:**  
  Organize your frequently used API requests into collections. This feature is particularly useful for maintaining consistency when working on multiple projects or collaborating with a team.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Quick API Debugging

- **Immediate Feedback:**  
  ARC's browser-based nature allows for rapid testing of endpoints. It’s ideal for debugging APIs during development without launching a full IDE.

- **Error Analysis:**  
  Quickly inspect response headers, status codes, and body content to troubleshoot issues.

### Lightweight Testing for Microservices

- **Efficient Testing:**  
  ARC is perfect for environments where numerous microservices interact. Its streamlined interface ensures minimal overhead while testing individual endpoints.

- **Rapid Iteration:**  
  Developers can test changes quickly, ensuring that each microservice responds as expected.

### Collaborative API Testing

- **Sharing Capabilities:**  
  Although ARC is primarily a personal tool, you can export request collections to share with team members. This facilitates collaboration and ensures that everyone is testing against the same endpoints.

- **Documentation and Versioning:**  
  Use ARC’s export feature to generate documentation for your API tests, aiding in version control and collaborative debugging sessions.

## Advanced Topics

### Customizing ARC

- **Settings and Preferences:**  
  ARC allows you to customize the interface and default settings to match your workflow. Adjust timeouts, default headers, and response display options to improve efficiency.

- **Extensions and Integrations:**  
  While ARC is lightweight, it can be integrated with other tools or used alongside browser developer tools for enhanced functionality.

### Integration with Other Tools

- **Exporting Collections:**  
  ARC supports exporting your request collections in various formats, making it easy to integrate with other API testing tools or CI/CD pipelines.

- **Collaboration with Version Control:**  
  Export and version your collections using Git or other version control systems to maintain a history of API tests and changes.
