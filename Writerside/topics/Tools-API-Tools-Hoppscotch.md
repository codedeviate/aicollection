## Examples of Using Hoppscotch

### Basic GET and POST Requests

#### GET Request Example

To fetch a list of posts from a sample API:

- **URL:** `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`
- **Method:** GET

**Steps:**

1. Enter the URL in Hoppscotch.
2. Select GET as the HTTP method.
3. Click **Send** and inspect the formatted JSON response.

#### POST Request Example

To create a new post, configure a POST request as follows:

- **URL:** `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`
- **Method:** POST
- **Headers:**
    - `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "title": "Hoppscotch API Guide",
    "body": "This post demonstrates how to use Hoppscotch for API testing.",
    "userId": 1
  }
  ```

**Steps:**

1. Choose POST and enter the URL.
2. In the Headers section, add `Content-Type: application/json`.
3. Paste the JSON payload in the Body editor.
4. Click **Send** to view the response, which confirms the creation of a new post.

### Handling Headers, Query Parameters, and Environment Variables

- **Custom Headers and Query Parameters:**  
  Use the designated sections in the request builder to add custom headers or query parameters without modifying the URL manually.

- **Environment Variables:**  
  Define variables (e.g., `baseUrl`) to dynamically update endpoints. For example, set `baseUrl` to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com` and use `{{baseUrl}}/posts` in your requests.

### Using WebSocket and GraphQL

Hoppscotch also supports advanced protocols:

- **GraphQL:**  
  Create GraphQL queries and mutations by selecting the GraphQL mode, writing your query, and sending the request to see a structured JSON response.

- **WebSocket:**  
  Establish a WebSocket connection to test real-time communication. Enter the WebSocket URL, connect, and send messages to view responses in real time.
