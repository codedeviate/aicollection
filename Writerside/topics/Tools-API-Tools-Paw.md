## Examples of Using Paw

### Basic GET and POST Requests

#### GET Request Example

To retrieve a list of posts from a sample API:

- **URL:** `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`
- **Method:** GET

**Steps:**

1. Create a new GET request.
2. Paste the URL and click **“Send Request”**.
3. View the JSON response in the response viewer, which formats the data for easy reading.

#### POST Request Example

To create a new post, set up a POST request with the following configuration:

- **URL:** `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`
- **Method:** POST
- **Headers:**
    - `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "title": "Paw API Guide",
    "body": "This post demonstrates how to use Paw for API testing.",
    "userId": 1
  }
  ```

**Steps:**

1. Create a new POST request.
2. Set the request method to POST and add the endpoint.
3. In the Body tab, choose JSON and paste your payload.
4. Click **“Send Request”** to confirm the creation of the post by reviewing the response.

### Environment Variables and Dynamic Values

Paw allows you to define variables to easily switch between different API environments:

1. **Create an Environment:**  
   In the sidebar, open the Environments panel and add a new environment (e.g., “Development”).

2. **Define Variables:**  
   Add variables such as `baseUrl` with a value like `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`.

3. **Use Variables in Requests:**  
   Reference variables using the syntax `{{ baseUrl }}`. For example, use `{{ baseUrl }}/posts` in your request URL.

4. **Switch Environments:**  
   Toggle between different environments to seamlessly test API calls across various configurations.

### Using Paw Extensions and Scripting

Paw supports extensions to further extend its functionality:

- **Scripting:**  
  Write custom scripts to generate dynamic data or transform responses. For example, you might script the automatic generation of authentication tokens before a request is sent.

- **Extensions:**  
  Browse the Paw Extension Marketplace for plugins that add new features such as advanced authentication methods, response validators, or even client code generators.

## Real-World Use Cases

### API Testing and Debugging

- **Real-Time Debugging:**  
  Use Paw to quickly test endpoints during development. The interactive response viewer allows you to debug headers, status codes, and payloads in real time.

- **Regression Testing:**  
  Organize your API requests into collections to perform regression tests. With Paw, you can quickly identify issues by running through a series of API calls.

### Designing and Prototyping APIs

- **Mock Servers:**  
  Use Paw’s mock server functionality to simulate API endpoints during the early stages of development. This helps front-end developers to prototype and test UI components without waiting for back-end development to be completed.

- **API Prototyping:**  
  Quickly design, test, and iterate on your API definitions, ensuring that endpoints are well-structured before moving to production.

### Collaboration and Documentation

- **Shared Workspaces:**  
  Paw makes it easy to share your API collections and environments with team members. This ensures that everyone is working with the latest version of your API specifications.

- **Automatic Documentation:**  
  Generate comprehensive API documentation directly from your Paw projects, providing an interactive and up-to-date reference for both internal teams and external stakeholders.

## Advanced Topics

### Generating Client Code

Paw can automatically generate client code in various programming languages and frameworks. This feature enables developers to quickly integrate API calls into their applications without writing boilerplate code manually.

- **Supported Languages:**  
  Generate code for languages like Swift, JavaScript, Python, and more.

- **Customization:**  
  Configure code generation settings to match your project’s specific needs, ensuring seamless integration into your development environment.

### Integrating with CI/CD Pipelines

While Paw is primarily a graphical tool, you can integrate its outputs into your CI/CD workflows:

- **Export Collections:**  
  Export your Paw collections in formats that can be used by automated testing tools.
