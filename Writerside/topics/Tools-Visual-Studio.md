## Configuration

Visual Studio (Full Edition) can be configured through the `Tools > Options` menu. Here is an example configuration for setting the editor preferences:

```json
{
    "TextEditor": {
        "FontSize": 12,
        "TabSize": 4,
        "InsertSpaces": true,
        "WordWrap": true
    },
    "ProjectsAndSolutions": {
        "BuildAndRun": {
            "OnRun": "PromptToSaveChanges"
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration sets the font size to 12, tab size to 4 spaces, inserts spaces instead of tabs, enables word wrap, and prompts to save changes before running the project.
