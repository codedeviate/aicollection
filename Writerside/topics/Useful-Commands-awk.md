# awk

`awk` is a powerful text-processing language and command-line utility that excels at pattern scanning and data extraction. Originally developed in the 1970s by Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan (hence the name “awk”), it has evolved into a robust language used for tasks ranging from simple reporting to complex data transformation. This in-depth article will guide you through the fundamentals of `awk`, its command-line parameters, scripting techniques, and a host of examples to illustrate its capabilities.

## Introduction to `awk`

`awk` is designed to work on files and streams of text data. It processes input line by line, breaking each line into fields based on a specified separator (default is whitespace). With its concise syntax, `awk` allows users to perform operations such as filtering, transforming, and summarizing text.

Key features include:

- **Pattern Matching:** Execute actions only when a line matches a specified pattern.
- **Field Processing:** Automatically split input into fields ($1, $2, …) based on a field separator.
- **Built-in Variables:** Access information about the current record (line) and the overall file.
- **Scripting Capabilities:** Write full programs with variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and arrays.
- **Portability:** Available on most Unix-like systems and many other platforms.

---

## Basic Syntax and Execution

At its simplest, an `awk` command follows the pattern:

```bash
awk 'pattern { action }' input_file
```

- **Pattern:** A condition or regular expression that determines when the action should be executed.
- **Action:** A series of commands enclosed in braces `{}` that are executed when the pattern is true.
- **Input File:** The file or stream that `awk` processes.

### Example: Print All Lines

```bash
awk '{ print }' sample.txt
```

This command prints every line in `sample.txt`. Here, the pattern is omitted, meaning the action applies to every record.

### Example: Print the First Field

```bash
awk '{ print $1 }' sample.txt
```

Here, `$1` represents the first field of each line (by default, fields are separated by whitespace).

---

## Command-Line Options and Parameters

`awk` comes with several command-line options that customize its behavior. While implementations (like GNU `awk` (gawk), mawk, or nawk) might offer additional options, here are the most common parameters:

- **`-F fs`**  
  Specify the input field separator `fs`.

  ```bash
  awk -F: '{ print $1 }' /etc/passwd
  ```

  In this example, `:` is used as the delimiter.

- **`-v var=value`**  
  Pre-assign a variable before processing begins.

  ```bash
  awk -v threshold=100 '{ if ($3 > threshold) print $0 }' data.txt
  ```

- **`-f script_file`**  
  Read the `awk` program from a file instead of from the command line.

  ```bash
  awk -f my_script.awk data.txt
  ```

- **`-W` Options (GNU `awk`)**  
  GNU `awk` supports various `-W` options, such as:
    - `-W version`: Print version information.
    - `-W lint`: Issue warnings about constructs that are not portable.
    - `-W posix`: Enforce POSIX compatibility.

- **`--re-interval`**  
  Enables the use of interval expressions (e.g., `a{1,3}`) in regular expressions (this is enabled by default in many modern versions).

- **`--help` and `--version`**  
  Display help and version information, respectively.

These parameters allow you to fine-tune how `awk` processes your data and script.

## Pattern-Action Structure

At the heart of `awk` is the pattern-action structure:

```awk
pattern { action }
```

- **Pattern:** Can be a regular expression, a relational expression, or even a combination of multiple conditions.
- **Action:** The set of instructions executed when the pattern matches. If no action is provided, `awk` prints the current record by default.

### Example: Filtering Lines

```bash
awk '/error/ { print $0 }' log.txt
```

This command prints all lines in `log.txt` that contain the word "error". The `/error/` is a regular expression that serves as the pattern.

### Example: Using Conditional Statements

```bash
awk '{ 
    if ($3 > 1000) 
        print $1, $3; 
    else 
        print $1, "Below threshold"; 
}' data.txt
```

In this example, each record is processed with a conditional statement to decide what to print.

## Built-in Variables

`awk` provides several built-in variables that hold useful information about the current input and the overall processing state.

- **`$0`**: The entire current line.
- **`$1, $2, …`**: The individual fields in the current line.
- **`NF`**: Number of fields in the current record.
- **`NR`**: Total number of records processed so far.
- **`FNR`**: Record number in the current file (useful when processing multiple files).
- **`FS`**: Input field separator (default is whitespace).
- **`OFS`**: Output field separator (default is a single space).
- **`RS`**: Input record separator (default is the newline character).
- **`ORS`**: Output record separator (default is the newline character).

### Example: Counting Fields and Lines

```bash
awk '{ print "Line " NR " has " NF " fields." }' sample.txt
```

This prints out the number of fields for each line along with the line number.

## Control Structures and Functions

`awk` supports many control structures found in traditional programming languages:

### Conditionals

```awk
if (condition) {
    # code
} else {
    # alternative code
}
```

### Loops

- **`while` Loop:**

  ```awk
  while (i <= NF) {
      print $i;
      i++;
  }
  ```

- **`for` Loop:**

  ```awk
  for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) {
      print $i;
  }
  ```

### Built-in Functions

`awk` provides several built-in functions for string manipulation, mathematical operations, and more:

- **`length([string])`**: Returns the length of the string (or the current record if omitted).
- **`substr(string, start, [length])`**: Extracts a substring.
- **`split(string, array, [separator])`**: Splits a string into an array.
- **`index(string, substring)`**: Returns the position of `substring` in `string`.
- **`match(string, regex)`**: Searches for a regex in `string` and returns the position.

### Example: Using Built-in Functions

```bash
awk '{
    len = length($0);
    sub_str = substr($0, 1, 10);
    print "Length:", len, "First 10 characters:", sub_str;
}' sample.txt
```

This snippet calculates the length of each record and prints the first 10 characters.

---

## Arrays and User-Defined Functions

### Arrays

`awk` arrays are associative, meaning their indices can be strings as well as numbers.

#### Example: Frequency Count

```bash
awk '{
    for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) {
        word = $i;
        count[word]++;
    }
}
END {
    for (word in count)
        print word, count[word];
}' sample.txt
```

This script counts the frequency of each word in `sample.txt`.

### User-Defined Functions

You can define your own functions in `awk` to encapsulate repeated logic.

#### Example: A Simple Function

```awk
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " name "!";
}

BEGIN {
    message = greet("Alice");
    print message;
}
```

Save the above in a file (e.g., `greet.awk`) and run it with:

```bash
awk -f greet.awk
```

---

## Practical Examples

### 1. Summing Up Numbers in a Column

Suppose you have a file `numbers.txt` with several numbers in the second column:

```bash
awk '{
    sum += $2
}
END {
    print "Total sum:", sum;
}' numbers.txt
```

### 2. Filtering Log Files

To filter log entries that contain the word "WARNING":

```bash
awk '/WARNING/ { print $0 }' system.log
```

### 3. Changing Field Separators

Assume you have a CSV file and want to change the delimiter:

```bash
awk -F, '{
    OFS="|";
    print $1, $2, $3
}' data.csv
```

This command reads the CSV (comma-separated) file and outputs the first three fields separated by pipes.

### 4. Formatting Output with `printf`

For better control over output formatting, you can use `printf`:

```bash
awk '{
    printf "User: %-10s | UID: %5d\n", $1, $3;
}' /etc/passwd
```

This command formats the output to align usernames and user IDs in a neat table.

## Advanced Techniques and Variants

### Using Multiple Files

When processing multiple files, `FNR` and `NR` are especially useful:

```bash
awk 'FNR==1 { print "Processing file:", FILENAME }
{ print }
END { print "Total records processed:", NR }' file1.txt file2.txt
```

### Regular Expression Enhancements

`awk` allows complex regular expressions for sophisticated matching:

```bash
awk '$0 ~ /^(ERROR|WARNING)/ { print $0 }' log.txt
```

This prints lines that start with either "ERROR" or "WARNING".

### Variants of `awk`

There are several versions of `awk` available:

- **GNU `awk` (gawk):** The most feature-rich version with extensions such as networking, internationalization, and more.
- **mawk:** Known for its speed and efficiency, though it may lack some of `gawk`’s advanced features.
- **nawk:** An extended version of the original `awk`, often used on older Unix systems.

Always check your system’s manual (`man awk`) to see which version you are using and what features are available.
