# comm

The `comm` command is a useful tool for comparing two sorted files line by line. It outputs three columns that help you quickly identify differences and similarities between the files. This comprehensive guide will explain the basic syntax, common options, practical examples, and advanced usage tips for the `comm` command so that you can incorporate it into your text processing and scripting workflows.

## Introduction

The `comm` command compares two files that are already sorted and displays the differences in three distinct columns:
- **Column 1:** Lines unique to the first file.
- **Column 2:** Lines unique to the second file.
- **Column 3:** Lines common to both files.

This line-by-line comparison is especially useful for tasks such as:
- Identifying differences between lists.
- Finding common elements in two datasets.
- Verifying changes between versions of sorted data.

## Basic Syntax and How `comm` Works

The general syntax of `comm` is:

```bash
comm [OPTIONS] FILE1 FILE2
```

- **FILE1 and FILE2:** These are the two files you want to compare.  
  **Note:** Both files must be sorted in the same way (typically in lexicographical order) for `comm` to work correctly.

By default, `comm` displays all three columns. If you want to hide one or more of these columns, you can use the appropriate options.

---

## Common Options and Parameters

### Suppressing Output Columns

`comm` provides options to suppress (not display) one or more of the output columns. This can be helpful when you’re interested in only a subset of the comparison:

- **`-1`:** Suppresses the first column (lines unique to FILE1).
- **`-2`:** Suppresses the second column (lines unique to FILE2).
- **`-3`:** Suppresses the third column (common lines between FILE1 and FILE2).

For example, to display only the lines common to both files, you can suppress columns 1 and 2:

```bash
comm -12 file1.txt file2.txt
```

Here, the combined option `-12` (or equivalently `-1 -2`) hides the first two columns, leaving only the common lines (column 3).

### File Sorting Requirement

It is critical to note that the input files **must be sorted**. If the files are not sorted, `comm` may produce incorrect or misleading results. If needed, you can sort the files before comparing them:

```bash
sort file1.txt -o file1.sorted.txt
sort file2.txt -o file2.sorted.txt
comm file1.sorted.txt file2.sorted.txt
```

---

## Practical Examples

### Comparing Two Sorted Files

Assume you have two files, `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`, that are already sorted. To compare them:

```bash
comm file1.txt file2.txt
```

This command produces output in three columns:
- **Column 1:** Lines unique to `file1.txt`
- **Column 2:** Lines unique to `file2.txt`
- **Column 3:** Lines present in both files

### Extracting Common Lines

To see only the lines that both files share, suppress the first and second columns:

```bash
comm -12 file1.txt file2.txt
```

### Extracting Unique Lines from Each File

- **Lines only in the first file:**

  ```bash
  comm -23 file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

  Here, `-2` suppresses the second column (unique to file2) and `-3` suppresses common lines.

- **Lines only in the second file:**

  ```bash
  comm -13 file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

  Here, `-1` suppresses the first column (unique to file1) and `-3` suppresses common lines.

### Using `comm` in a Pipeline

You can also integrate `comm` into a pipeline. For example, if you have two unsorted files, you might sort them on the fly:

```bash
comm <(sort file1.txt) <(sort file2.txt)
```

This technique uses process substitution to sort the files before passing them to `comm`.

## Advanced Usage and Tips

### Sorting Files Before Comparison

If your files are not already sorted, always sort them before using `comm`. For example, to compare two unsorted lists of names:

```bash
comm <(sort unsorted1.txt) <(sort unsorted2.txt)
```

### Integrating `comm` with Other Tools

`comm` works well in combination with other commands:
- **Diff Alternatives:** While `diff` shows detailed changes between files, `comm` provides a concise overview of common and unique lines.
- **Data Processing:** Use `comm` to compare outputs from commands like `cut` or `awk` to analyze data differences in a structured format.

For example, if you have two lists of usernames extracted from different systems:

```bash
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd > users1.txt
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd.backup > users2.txt
comm -12 <(sort users1.txt) <(sort users2.txt)
```

This shows usernames common to both files.

## Conclusion and Further Reading

The `comm` command is a straightforward yet powerful tool for comparing sorted files. By outputting differences in three clear columns, it helps you quickly identify unique and common lines between files. Whether you’re comparing lists, verifying backups, or processing data in scripts, mastering `comm` can simplify many common tasks.
