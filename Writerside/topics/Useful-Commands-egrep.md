# egrep

`egrep` is a variant of the classic `grep` command that supports extended regular expressions (EREs) by default. This makes it especially powerful when you need to perform complex pattern matching without the need for excessive escaping. In many modern systems, `egrep` is equivalent to running `grep -E`, but it remains a popular, standalone command due to its historical usage and simplicity when working with extended regex patterns.

Below is an in-depth guide on the `egrep` command, including its syntax, options, practical examples, and advanced techniques.

## Introduction

`egrep` (extended grep) enhances traditional pattern matching by supporting extended regular expressions. This allows users to write more expressive and concise patterns using constructs such as:

- **Alternation (`|`):** Match one pattern or another.
- **Grouping (`()`):** Group sub-patterns.
- **Quantifiers (`+`, `?`, `{m,n}`):** Match one or more, zero or one, or a range of occurrences.

Because these features are built into `egrep` by default, it often results in cleaner command lines compared to the basic `grep` (which requires escaping some characters).

---

## Basic Syntax and How `egrep` Works

The general syntax for `egrep` is:

```bash
egrep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]
```

- **PATTERN:** A regular expression (using extended regex syntax) that you want to search for.
- **FILE(s):** One or more files to search. If no file is provided, `egrep` reads from standard input.

### Example: Simple Search

To search for lines that contain either "error" or "failure" in a file:

```bash
egrep "error|failure" logfile.txt
```

This command prints all lines in `logfile.txt` that contain either of the two words.

## Command-Line Options and Parameters

`egrep` shares many of its options with `grep`, and here are some of the most useful ones:

### Pattern Specification

- **Extended Regular Expressions:**  
  Since `egrep` uses extended regex by default, you can write patterns with less escaping. For example:

  ```bash
  egrep "(cat|dog)s?" animals.txt
  ```

  This pattern matches "cat", "cats", "dog", or "dogs".

### Case Sensitivity and Inversion

- **`-i` or `--ignore-case`:**  
  Perform a case-insensitive search.

  ```bash
  egrep -i "error" logfile.txt
  ```

- **`-v` or `--invert-match`:**  
  Invert the search, displaying lines that do *not* match the pattern.

  ```bash
  egrep -v "DEBUG" logfile.txt
  ```

### Line Numbering and File Name Display

- **`-n` or `--line-number`:**  
  Prefix each matching line with its line number.

  ```bash
  egrep -n "warning" logfile.txt
  ```

- **`-H`:**  
  Print the file name with the output lines (useful when searching multiple files).

  ```bash
  egrep -H "TODO" *.c
  ```

### Context Options

- **`-A NUM`:**  
  Print NUM lines of context *after* the matching line.

  ```bash
  egrep -A 2 "error" logfile.txt
  ```

- **`-B NUM`:**  
  Print NUM lines of context *before* the matching line.

  ```bash
  egrep -B 2 "error" logfile.txt
  ```

- **`-C NUM`:**  
  Print NUM lines of context both before and after each match.

  ```bash
  egrep -C 3 "error" logfile.txt
  ```

## Practical Examples

### Searching with Extended Regular Expressions

**Example 1: Matching Multiple Alternatives**

Suppose you want to match lines that contain either "apple", "banana", or "cherry":

```bash
egrep "(apple|banana|cherry)" fruits.txt
```

This will print lines from `fruits.txt` that include any of those words.

**Example 2: Optional Characters and Repetition**

To match lines where a word might be plural (ending with an optional "s"):

```bash
egrep "dog(s)?" animals.txt
```

This matches both "dog" and "dogs".

### Filtering Multiple Files

Search for the pattern "function" across all `.c` and `.h` files, displaying the file name:

```bash
egrep -H "function" *.c *.h
```

### Inverting Matches

To display all lines in a configuration file that do not contain the word "disabled":

```bash
egrep -v "disabled" config.ini
```

### Showing Context Lines

When troubleshooting a log file, you might want to see the lines surrounding an error:

```bash
egrep -C 3 "ERROR" server.log
```

This prints three lines before and after each line containing "ERROR".

## Advanced Usage and Tips

- **Recursive Searches:**  
  While `egrep` itself does not support recursion, you can combine it with the `-r` option of `grep` (or use `grep -Er`) to search directories recursively:

  ```bash
  grep -Er "pattern" /path/to/directory
  ```

  (This is equivalent to using `egrep` on each file found recursively.)

- **File Filtering with `find`:**  
  For more advanced searches, use `find` in combination with `egrep`:

  ```bash
  find . -type f -name "*.log" -exec egrep -H "fatal" {} +
  ```

  This command searches for the word "fatal" in all `.log` files within the current directory tree.

- **Combining with Other Commands:**  
  `egrep` works well in pipelines. For example, to list active processes and filter for specific patterns:

  ```bash
  ps aux | egrep "apache|nginx"
  ```

- **Regular Expression Efficiency:**  
  With extended regular expressions, be mindful of potential pitfalls such as catastrophic backtracking. Always test your patterns on sample data.
