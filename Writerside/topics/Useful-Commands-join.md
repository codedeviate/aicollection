# join

The `join` command is a powerful utility for merging two files based on a common field (often thought of as performing a relational database join operation on sorted files). It reads two files—each sorted on the join field—and produces lines that combine fields from both files. This guide will walk you through the basic syntax, common options, practical examples, and advanced tips for using `join` effectively in your text processing and data merging tasks.

## Introduction

The `join` command is used to combine lines from two files based on a common field. It works much like a "join" operation in SQL databases. Because `join` expects its input files to be sorted on the join field, it is common practice to preprocess your data with the `sort` command before using `join`.

**Common use cases include:**
- Merging related data stored in separate files (e.g., combining customer records with transaction records).
- Creating reports by correlating information from multiple data sources.
- Performing simple relational data operations directly from the command line.

## Basic Syntax and How `join` Works

The general syntax for `join` is:

```bash
join [OPTIONS] FILE1 FILE2
```

- **FILE1 and FILE2:** These are the two files to be joined.
- **OPTIONS:** Flags that control the behavior of the join, such as the field delimiter, join field selection, and output formatting.

**Key Points:**
- **Sorted Input:**  
  Both input files must be sorted on the join field. For example, if joining on the first field, the files should be sorted lexicographically by that field.
- **Default Behavior:**  
  By default, `join` uses whitespace as the field delimiter and the first field in each file as the join field.

---

## Common Options and Parameters

### Specifying the Field Delimiter

- **`-t CHAR`:**  
  Use this option to set a custom field delimiter instead of the default whitespace.  
  **Example:**  
  To join files with comma-separated values, use:
  ```bash
  join -t ',' file1.csv file2.csv
  ```

### Selecting Join Fields

- **`-1 FIELD` and `-2 FIELD`:**  
  These options allow you to specify which field from FILE1 and FILE2, respectively, should be used for the join. Fields are numbered starting from 1.  
  **Example:**  
  To join on the second field in FILE1 and the third field in FILE2:
  ```bash
  join -1 2 -2 3 file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

### Controlling the Output Format

- **`-o FORMAT`**  
  Allows you to specify the format of the output. You can list which fields to display from FILE1 and FILE2.  
  **Example:**  
  To output the join field, the second field from FILE1, and the fourth field from FILE2:
  ```bash
  join -o 0,1.2,2.4 file1.txt file2.txt
  ```  
  Here, `0` refers to the join field (common to both files), `1.2` refers to field 2 from FILE1, and `2.4` to field 4 from FILE2.

### Including Unpairable Lines

- **`-a FILENUM`**  
  Prints unpairable lines from the specified file (1 or 2) in addition to the matching lines.
- **`-e STRING`**  
  Replaces missing input fields with the specified STRING in the output.
- **`-v FILENUM`**  
  Outputs only the lines from the specified file (1 or 2) that did not have a matching join field in the other file.

## Practical Examples

### Basic Join of Two Files

Imagine you have two files that share a common identifier in the first field.

**file1.txt:**
```
101 Alice
102 Bob
103 Charlie
```

**file2.txt:**
```
101 Engineering
102 Sales
104 Marketing
```

To join these files on the first field:
```bash
join file1.txt file2.txt
```

**Output:**
```
101 Alice Engineering
102 Bob Sales
```

*Note:* The line with key `103` from `file1.txt` and the line with key `104` from `file2.txt` are omitted because they do not have matching keys.

### Joining Files with Custom Delimiters

If the files are CSV files with comma delimiters, use the `-t` option.

**file1.csv:**
```
101,Alice
102,Bob
103,Charlie
```

**file2.csv:**
```
101,Engineering
102,Sales
104,Marketing
```

Join them by specifying the comma delimiter:
```bash
join -t ',' file1.csv file2.csv
```

**Output:**
```
101,Alice,Engineering
102,Bob,Sales
```

### Selecting Specific Fields in the Output

To customize the output format, use the `-o` option. For instance, if you want to output the join field, then the second field from `file1.txt` (the name), and the second field from `file2.txt` (the department), you can do:

```bash
join -o 0,1.2,2.2 file1.txt file2.txt
```

**Output:**
```
101 Alice Engineering
102 Bob Sales
```

### Including Unmatched Lines

To include lines that do not have a matching join field in one or both files, you can use the `-a` option.

For example, to include all lines from `file1.txt` (even those without a match in `file2.txt`):

```bash
join -a 1 file1.txt file2.txt
```

**Output:**
```
101 Alice Engineering
102 Bob Sales
103 Charlie
```

Similarly, to output only lines from `file2.txt` that did not have a match:

```bash
join -v 2 file1.txt file2.txt
```

**Output:**
```
104 Marketing
```

## Advanced Usage and Tips

- **Ensure Sorted Input:**  
  Remember, `join` requires that both files are sorted on the join field. You can sort files on the desired field using the `sort` command. For example:
  ```bash
  sort -k1,1 file1.txt -o file1.sorted.txt
  sort -k1,1 file2.txt -o file2.sorted.txt
  join file1.sorted.txt file2.sorted.txt
  ```

- **Handling Missing Data:**  
  Use the `-e` option to substitute a placeholder (like `N/A`) for missing fields:
  ```bash
  join -e "N/A" -a 1 -a 2 file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

- **Using Custom Field Separators in Input Files:**  
  If your files use different delimiters or require special processing before joining, consider preprocessing with tools like `sed` or `awk`.

- **Complex Output Formats:**  
  The `-o` option is very powerful for creating custom output formats. Experiment with different field combinations to generate reports that suit your needs.

## Conclusion and Further Reading

The `join` command is an indispensable tool for merging data from two sorted files based on a common field. Its flexibility with delimiters, join fields, and output formatting makes it a valuable asset for data analysis, report generation, and shell scripting. By mastering `join`, you can simplify the process of correlating data from multiple sources directly from the command line.
