# rsync

`rsync` is a fast and versatile file copying tool commonly used for synchronizing files and directories either locally or remotely. It is renowned for its efficiency, as it transfers only the differences between the source and the destination, which minimizes data transfer and speeds up backups and mirroring. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about `rsync`—from its basic syntax and options to advanced usage scenarios—with plenty of examples to help you integrate it into your workflow.

## Introduction

`rsync` is widely used for tasks such as:
- Backing up data from one location to another.
- Mirroring entire directories across servers.
- Incremental file transfers where only changed portions are transmitted.
- Synchronizing files over networks with minimal bandwidth usage.

The tool's power comes from its ability to compare the source and destination at the file or even block level, transferring only what’s needed. This not only saves time but also reduces network load, making `rsync` a favorite among system administrators and developers.

## Basic Syntax and How `rsync` Works

The general syntax of `rsync` is as follows:

```bash
rsync [OPTIONS] SOURCE DESTINATION
```

- **SOURCE:** The file or directory you wish to copy or synchronize.
- **DESTINATION:** The target location, which can be local or remote. Remote locations are specified in the format `user@host:/path`.

### Example: Basic Local Copy

```bash
rsync -av /path/to/source/ /path/to/destination/
```

This command synchronizes the contents of `/path/to/source/` with `/path/to/destination/` using archive mode and verbose output.

---

## Common Command-Line Options and Parameters

`rsync` offers a plethora of options that allow you to fine-tune its behavior. Below are some of the most commonly used options:

### Archive Mode (`-a`)

- **`-a` or `--archive`:**  
  Enables archive mode, which is a shorthand for a combination of options that preserve symbolic links, permissions, timestamps, and more. It also enables recursive copying.

  ```bash
  rsync -a source/ destination/
  ```

### Verbose and Progress Options (`-v`, `--progress`, etc.)

- **`-v` or `--verbose`:**  
  Increases the verbosity of the output, giving you more insight into the transfer process.

  ```bash
  rsync -av source/ destination/
  ```

- **`--progress`:**  
  Displays progress information during the transfer, including percentage completed and transfer speed.

  ```bash
  rsync -av --progress source/ destination/
  ```

### Compression (`-z`)

- **`-z` or `--compress`:**  
  Compresses file data during the transfer, which is especially useful for remote transfers over slower networks.

  ```bash
  rsync -avz source/ destination/
  ```

### Deletion (`--delete`)

- **`--delete`:**  
  Deletes files in the destination that no longer exist in the source, making the destination an exact mirror of the source.

  ```bash
  rsync -av --delete source/ destination/
  ```

### Partial Transfers and Resuming (`--partial`, `--append`)

- **`--partial`:**  
  Keeps partially transferred files so that if the transfer is interrupted, it can be resumed without starting over.

- **`--append`:**  
  Appends data to files that are already partially transferred.

  ```bash
  rsync -av --partial source/ destination/
  ```

### Excluding Files and Directories (`--exclude`, `--exclude-from`)

- **`--exclude 'pattern'`:**  
  Excludes files or directories matching the specified pattern from being synchronized.

- **`--exclude-from=FILE`:**  
  Reads a list of patterns from a file to exclude multiple files or directories.

  ```bash
  rsync -av --exclude 'tmp/' --exclude '*.log' source/ destination/
  ```

  Or, using an exclude file:

  ```bash
  rsync -av --exclude-from='exclude-list.txt' source/ destination/
  ```

### Remote Transfers (`-e ssh`)

- **`-e` or `--rsh=COMMAND`:**  
  Specifies the remote shell to use. Typically, you use `-e ssh` for secure transfers.

  ```bash
  rsync -avz -e ssh source/ user@remotehost:/path/to/destination/
  ```

---

## Practical Examples

### Local Synchronization

Synchronize the contents of a local directory:

```bash
rsync -av /home/user/documents/ /mnt/backup/documents/
```

This command copies all files from `/home/user/documents/` to `/mnt/backup/documents/`, preserving file permissions and timestamps.

### Remote Synchronization over SSH

Transfer files securely to a remote server:

```bash
rsync -avz -e ssh /home/user/projects/ user@remote.server.com:/var/www/projects/
```

This command compresses data during transfer and uses SSH for secure communication.

### Incremental Backups

Perform an incremental backup where only changed files are transferred:

```bash
rsync -av --delete /home/user/data/ /mnt/backup/data/
```

Files that have not changed since the last sync are skipped, and files removed from the source are also deleted from the backup.

### Mirroring Directories

Create an exact mirror of a source directory, including deletion of files not present in the source:

```bash
rsync -av --delete /var/www/html/ /backup/www/html/
```

This is useful for web servers or other environments where the destination must match the source exactly.

### Excluding Specific Files or Directories

Exclude temporary files and log files from the synchronization process:

```bash
rsync -av --exclude '*.tmp' --exclude 'logs/' /home/user/app/ /mnt/backup/app/
```

This command ensures that files ending in `.tmp` and the entire `logs/` directory are not copied.

## Advanced Usage and Tips

- **Dry Run (`-n` or `--dry-run`):**  
  Always test your `rsync` commands with the dry-run option to see what changes will be made without actually transferring files.

  ```bash
  rsync -av --delete --dry-run source/ destination/
  ```

- **Using Checksums (`-c`):**  
  If you need to verify file integrity beyond modification time and size, use the `-c` option to force `rsync` to compare files using a checksum.

  ```bash
  rsync -avc source/ destination/
  ```

- **Bandwidth Limiting (`--bwlimit`):**  
  Limit the bandwidth used by `rsync` during transfer to avoid saturating your network connection.

  ```bash
  rsync -av --bwlimit=1000 source/ destination/
  ```

- **Logging:**  
  Redirect output to a log file to keep a record of synchronization activity.

  ```bash
  rsync -av source/ destination/ | tee rsync.log
  ```

- **Combining with Cron for Scheduled Backups:**  
  Automate backups by scheduling `rsync` with cron. For example, create a cron job to run a backup every night:

  ```bash
  0 2 * * * rsync -av --delete /home/user/ /mnt/backup/
  ```
