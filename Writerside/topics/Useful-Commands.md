# Useful Commands

Operating systems like Linux, Windows, and macOS provide powerful command-line interfaces (CLI) that enable users to perform tasks efficiently and automate processes. These commands form the backbone of system management, file handling, and troubleshooting, allowing users to interact directly with the OS beyond graphical interfaces.

This article serves as an introduction to the utility of commands, highlighting their importance and categorization, without delving into specifics. Detailed usage and examples will be explored in dedicated subarticles.

## Why Use Command-Line Commands?

While graphical user interfaces (GUIs) offer ease of use, command-line commands provide several advantages:
- **Efficiency**: Tasks like file manipulation, system monitoring, and software installation can often be completed faster.
- **Automation**: Commands can be combined in scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
- **Control**: Direct access to system settings and processes allows for fine-tuned adjustments.
- **Universality**: Commands are consistent across many systems, making them a valuable skill for IT professionals.
