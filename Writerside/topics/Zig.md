# Zig
This section contains snippets of code written in Zig, a general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity, performance, and safety.
Zig is designed to be a robust alternative to C, providing modern features while maintaining low-level control over system resources. The following examples demonstrate various Zig functionalities and best practices to help you understand and implement Zig in your projects effectively.

## History
The Zig programming language was developed by Andrew Kelley. Here is a brief history:

- **2015**: Andrew Kelley begins working on Zig as a personal project.
- **2016**: The first public release of Zig is made available.
- **2017**: Zig 0.1.0 is released, marking the first official version of the language.
- **2018**: Zig 0.2.0 is released, introducing improvements and new features.
- **2019**: Zig 0.4.0 is released, with significant enhancements and performance improvements.
- **2020**: Zig 0.6.0 is released, adding new language features and further optimizations.
- **2021**: Zig 0.8.0 is released, continuing the evolution of the language with new features and improvements.
- **2022**: Zig 1.0.0 is released, marking a major milestone in the language's development. This version includes significant changes to the language design, compiler, and standard library.
- **2022**: The introduction of the new `std.zig` module, which provides a modern and streamlined API for building libraries and applications.
- **2022**: Support for incremental compilation is added to Zig, allowing developers to build and test their code in smaller increments.
- **2023**: The Zig compiler is optimized for better performance on Apple Silicon chips, taking advantage of the ARM64 architecture.

Zig continues to evolve, with ongoing work to improve the language and add new features. The community remains active, contributing to the growth and development of the language.
