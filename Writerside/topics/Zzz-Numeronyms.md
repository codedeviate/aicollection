## What Is a Numeronym?

A numeronym is a type of abbreviation where a **number replaces letters** within a word, often representing the number of omitted characters. These abbreviations can be formed in different ways:

1. **First and Last Letter with a Number** – The first and last letter of the word are kept, and a number represents the number of missing letters in between.
    - Example: **i18n** → "internationalization" (the number 18 replaces the omitted letters between 'i' and 'n').

2. **Full Words Replaced with Numbers** – A number replaces an entire syllable or sound in the word.
    - Example: **B2B** → "Business to Business" (the number 2 replaces "to").

3. **Shortened Numbers and Letters Combined** – Some numeronyms are simple shorthand for common phrases.
    - Example: **24/7** → "24 hours a day, 7 days a week."
